            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>That God for Chriſts ſake, or Chriſts merits ſake doth impute our faith for righteouſneſſe unto us,</hi> p. 11. and then, <hi>in this ſenſe onely, and not any other, may the active and paſsive obedience of Chriſt be ſaid to be the righteouſneſſe by which we are juſtified,</hi> p. 13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This faith</hi> (not in a figurative, but properſenſe) <hi>is required and accepted for righteouſneſſe, and hath the ſame favours, rewards, and priviledges upon the tender of it that ſhould have beene given to men in regard of that legall righteouſneſſe had it beene ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, &amp;c.</hi> p. 15. 16. <hi>It is as good,</hi> p. 6. <hi>as available and effectuall to juſtification,</hi> p. 15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is all that God requires of men to their juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in ſtead of the righteouſneſſe of the Law,</hi> p. 92. And therefore <hi>if God ſhall not impute or account it unto them for this righteouſneſſe, it ſhould ſtand them in no ſteed at all to their juſtification,</hi> p. 92. Yea,</p>
            <p>He calleth it from <hi>Phil. 3. 9. a righteouſneſſe which God himſelfe hath found out, and which he will owne and countenance &amp; account for righteouſneſſe unto men, and no other but this,</hi> p. 86. <hi>the righteouſnes there mentioned is as being and ſtanding in faith, &amp;c.</hi> and he calleth it <hi>a righteouſnes which will certainely carry it, notwithſtanding all the unlikelihood and ſeeming im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections of it, and that the thing is fully concluded and eſtabliſhed with God accordingly,</hi> ib.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Helena</hi> he contendeth for, in Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching firſt, and now in Print. <hi>The condition appointed by God, and required on mans part,</hi> in oppoſition to Chriſts righteouſneſſe, the object; which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neith the <hi>object of this faith as juſtifying,</hi> p. 38. In this which is but inherent righteouſneſſe, a weake and imperfect righteouſneſſe, which muſt have help
<pb facs="tcp:50493:6"/>
to make it accepted, if ever it be ſo, in this I ſay will he be found not that which is by faith as an inſtrument, received and put on, and would have us to be ſo too, which God forbid. It will not ſteed us before Gods tribunall, his friend <hi>Pareus</hi> calleth it <hi>Blaſphemy againſt the holy Ghoſt,</hi> as in the front is ſhewed; the Apoſtles text is for <hi>faith of Chriſt,</hi> and his righteouſneſſe, his righteouſneſſe being that which is imputed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 6. 11. as I ſhall fully ſhew.</p>
            <p>It is obſervable, that this which is here by him eſtabliſhed, is notwithſtanding by him alſo in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect confounded with remiſſion of ſinnes which with him <hi>formally juſtifieth.</hi> This he calleth the <hi>imputing of righteouſneſſe. To ſhew that God hath no other righteouſneſſe to conferre upon a ſinner, but that which ſtands in forgiveneſſe of ſinnes,</hi> Tr. 2. p. 7. <hi>That righteouſneſſe which God is ſaid to impute unto men through faith, is nothing elſe (being interpreted) but the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes,</hi> Tr. 1. p. 75. <hi>this</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>hath the priviledges, though not the nature of a perfect righteouſneſſe,</hi> p. 76. But let that paſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fully conſidered in d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e places.</p>
            <p>Againe, the thing he mainly oppoſeth, is the active obedience or righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt, of this he ſaith, <hi>amongſt the variety of the objects of faith in the Scriptures, there is not the leaſt mention as before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And (eſtabliſhing the paſſive obedience as the meritorious cauſe imputed in its effects, now faith, now pardon of ſinnes) telleth us, <hi>That if Chriſt had fulfilled the Law for us in our ſteede, there had beene no occaſion of his dying for us, and that there is
<pb facs="tcp:50493:6"/>
no light clearer then this,</hi> Concluſ. 7. Tr. 2. p. 10.</p>
            <p>Yea though he calleth it <hi>an efficient remote; not immediate, qualifying him to, but having no immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate influence,</hi> Tr. 2. p. 69.</p>
            <p>Yet it is not <hi>cauſa ſine qua non,</hi> with him; <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>And for the active obedience of Chriſt in the production of this effect, Juſtification, Mr. <hi>John Goodwine,</hi> ſeemeth to me to ſay enough to eſtabliſh it in good earneſt, and to have no cauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ſame, which yet he often doth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We deny not the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt in it ſelfe, rather we ſuppoſe and eſtabliſh it,</hi> p. 16, <hi>neither the abſolute neceſsity of it; neither the meritorious efficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie or cauſality, in reſpect of the Juſtification of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> p. 16. <hi>but beleeves, &amp;c. we are juſtified for the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ſake of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, there being a full conſideration in it, why God ſhould juſtifie thoſe that beleeve in him.</hi> It is true, he meaneth the <hi>Paſsive righteouſneſſe chiefely,</hi> p. 16. <hi>which doth not exclude the Active.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, <hi>that it falling into the Paſsive, and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in conjunction with it hath influence into, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributeth towards the juſtification of a ſinner, as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged on both ſides,</hi> p. 7. That, <hi>together they may be called a righteouſneſſe; for which; but at no hand with which we are juſtified,</hi> p. 62. Wherefore they muſt be both together included or excluded, and in the ſame ſort.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:50493:7"/>He will <hi>not have the Active and Paſsive righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe ſeparated in reſpect of this common effect juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> p. 132. and ſaith, <hi>as the Active ſeparated will not profit;</hi> ſo <hi>neither will the Paſsive it ſelfe be found it ſelfe, that is an atonement or expiation of ſinne accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the wili and purpoſe of God, except we bring in the Active to it,</hi> p. 132.</p>
            <p>And elſewhere, <hi>Though it be not ſatisfactory ſimply and directly in it ſelf, nor contributing any thing by way of merit towards the juſtification of a ſinner, ſo that God is moved thereby to juſtifie any man,</hi> (theſe are his hungry and cold; if conſiſtent, expreſſions) <hi>Yet it cannot be denied—but it hath a moving efficiencie—qualifying in part the Sacrifice of Chriſt for the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and height of acceptation with God,</hi> Tr. 2. p. 81. <hi>It was of abſolute neceſsity to qualifie and fit the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the Altar, to tender him a perſon meete by his death, and Sacrifice to make an atonement.—The abſolute holineſſe and righteouſneſſe of the humanity it ſelfe was of neceſſary concurrence thereunto,</hi> p. 201.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is great weight and moment in the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Chriſts perſon, to aſſure or ſecure the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of men concerning their juſtification by his death.—It qualifieth his perſon at leaſt in part for that meritoriouſneſſe of his death, which may ſtand the world in ſteed for their juſtification,</hi> p. 204.</p>
            <p>He acknowledgeth <hi>the infinite perfection and worth of it,</hi> p. 87.</p>
            <p>And that <hi>the habituall holineſſe of his perſon and morall righteouſneſſe or Active obedience of his life</hi>—are <hi>eſſentially and directly requiſite to make his death and ſufferings, Juſtification and life and ſalvation to them as hath beene further opened in the former part
<pb facs="tcp:50493:7"/>
of this Treatiſe,</hi> Tr. 2. p. 54. <hi>Theſe are to be conſidered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true he teacheth us, that <hi>Chriſts Active obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, that of nature and life were due for himſelfe.</hi> But will not conſider that what is due cannot me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, he that <hi>doth all is but an unprofitable ſervant, he hath done but what he ought.</hi> And if the merit be deſtroyed, how can it make Chriſt a Prieſt, or his Sacrifice an atonement? how is it, in its ſelfe an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement or expiation of ſinne as before?</p>
            <p>And what is become of our juſtification and ſalvation, yea of the glory of Chriſt?</p>
            <p>You ſhall read dangerous doctrine about the imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, <hi>that it is ours but in the effect, not the ſinne it ſelfe,</hi> as his opinion is alſo of the imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, as if our ſpirituall death in which we were borne, ſuppoſed not our ſinne, <hi>Adams,</hi> ours ſinne by imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne he ſaith, (extenuating it much though he ſaith he doth it not) It is a <hi>ſinfull ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Not out of envie, malice, or other ſiniſter end or intention, which are the maine ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations of a ſinne, and rayſing the offenſiveneſſe of it to the greateſt height; but out of an inconſiderat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or incogitance, which though it be no cloake for ſinne, yet is it a roote of the leaſt bitterneſſe or provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from whence it is lightly poſsible for ſinne to ſpring,</hi> Concluſ. 10. p. 19. 20. 2. Tr. Are you of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne? I think otherwiſe, and in due place ſhew it.</p>
            <p>And what doe you conceive of this in his foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth <hi>Concluſ. The ſentence or curſe of the Law was
<pb facs="tcp:50493:8"/>
not properly executed on Chriſt in his death. But his death was a ground or conſideration to God whereby to diſpence with his Law, to let fall or ſuſpend exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the penalty or curſe therein threatned.—Neither did God require the death and ſuffering of Chriſt as a valuable conſideration whereon to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpence with his Law, towards thoſe that doe beleeve more, or ſo much in a way of ſatisfaction to his juſtice, then his wiſdome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for God might with as much juſtice have paſſed the tranſgreſsion of his Law without conſideration or ſatisfaction,</hi> p. 33.</p>
            <p>What I conceive I tell you in due places. I beſeech you interpoſe your ſelves to the ſetling of our brother. I perſwade my ſelfe and know many of you are the ſame with our learned re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Divines, who whether they are for that I oppoſe, and in that name enemies of this impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, I leave alſo the world to judge.</p>
            <p>I profeſſe my ſelfe amongſt <hi>the friends of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation</hi> (as Mr. <hi>G.</hi> calleth us, 2. <hi>Tr. p.</hi> 147.) of the Active and Paſſive obedience of Chriſt; the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion he holds, I alſo hate, (I thanke Chriſt) and as yet ſee no cauſe to change my judgement.</p>
            <p>If Mr. <hi>Goodwine</hi> hath yet more to ſay in this cauſe, if he be more ſuccinct, replying in a Chriſtian and brotherly manner (which I earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire) he ſhall finde me <hi>cedere neſcium,</hi> ready for a further triall; and if in any thing I ſhall not agree with others, my reverend Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and they ſhall lovingly advertiſe me of it; they ſhall finde me a lover and imbracer of the truth ſhewed; <hi>Homo ſum, nihil humanum à

Little honour is gotten by the Captaine that doth and glorieth in this. Theſe might have beene neglected with more honour. The ſoundeſt and faireſt paſſages in which ſtrength lieth, ſhould have beene his ambition, not looſe and foule ones, much leſſe the fouler and looſer paſſages.

Our times have beene times of licence under the name of recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation: and mans nature is foully degenerated that can recreate it ſelfe thus: It is not wiſdome to make a paſtime of ſinne. The labour and ſtrength to which, may well be ſuſpected that is thus repaired. It were evill in tranſient words, for which yet we muſt give an account; it is worſe in publiſhed bookes, which may continue with the world. It is an evill example, ſome adverſaries will laugh, others blaſpheme, the Lord give repentance for it to him that did it, and thoſe that take pleaſure therein.</p>
            <p>You will ſay, he was provoked: It ſhould not have beene, had it beene ſo, <hi>wiſe men ſhould have borne with</hi> ſuch as they account <hi>fooles;</hi> and it was neither wiſdome nor ſtrength to be overcome to ſuch evill; <hi>evill ſhould have been overcome with good;</hi> this had beene to be approved of men, and acceptable to God.

The grace of God ſhutteth not out the juſtice of God in our juſtification, but onely ſhutteth out the juſtice of, man, that is to ſay, the juſtice of our workes, as to be meanes of deſerving our juſtification,</hi> ib.</p>
            <p>I have read of <hi>Juſtification freely by grace through the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption which is in Jeſus Chriſt, whom God hath ſet forth a propiriation through faith in his bloud to declare his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe—in it God is juſt and the juſtifier,</hi> Rom. 3.</p>
            <p>When as faith is taken in a relative ſenſe with its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, Chriſt and his perfect righteouſneſſe, and is imputed to <hi>Abraham</hi> for righteouſneſſe, <hi>Abraham</hi> is <hi>made juſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,</hi> God judgeth juſtly in accounting him ſo, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing him ſo, with this he may ſtand in judgement and be as if he had never ſinned, as if he had perfectly fulfilled the Law in his owne perſon.</p>
            <p>It is not ſo where faith is taken in a proper ſenſe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is that accounting faith for righteouſneſſe a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous judgement; or that which is in truth. Faith thus ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken is a worke of the Law, (ſome thinke) a part of inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent righteouſneſſe, as charity, an imperfect grace, it cannot ſtand in judgement.</p>
            <p>Faith in the relative ſenſe <hi>eſtabliſheth the Law</hi> (as you ſhall ſee) bringeth in what it requireth, and ſo juſtifieth, and ſo juſtification is a worke of mercy and judgement.</p>
            <p>I profeſſe I could never indure what I read in Mr. <hi>Wot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi> that<note n="h" place="margin">Poena &amp; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia ſunt adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa.</note>

            <p>2. When as you tell us, <hi>p. 24. every Act of judging and eſteening a thing to be as it is,</hi> is <hi>not an imputing or accounting it to another, which yet muſt be if it be rightly defined by the rules of a definition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Anſwer is Mr. <hi>W.</hi> did not define it, he ſaid not it is, but it ſignifieth, which is not the manner of him that defineth. Neither hath he a word of imputing it to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, upon which what you tell us of the Sun and Moone, &amp;c. are built, they are Caſtles in the aire.</p>
            <p>3. You ſay, <hi>when God imputes either my faith to me, or Chriſts righteouſneſſe (the one being the Scripture phraſe, the other Mr.</hi> Ws.) <hi>for my righteouſneſſe; he doth not judge any thing to be as indeed it is: for neither is my faith, nor the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of Chriſt indeed my righteouſneſſe, but my faith in that grace which God hath conſecrated and ordained to bring me into communion and fellowſhip of that righteouſneſſe that is of that Juſtification, &amp;c. which Chriſt by the merit of his life

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and for all thoſe that beleeve in him. Therefore the phraſe of imputing doth not ſignifie an act of judgement, &amp;c. by which a man judgeth a thing to be as it is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The Scripture, and what hath beene ſpoken are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt you, which ſhew Gods judgement according to truth. I oppoſe it to your bare negation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the Scripture as it mentioneth <hi>imputation of faith,</hi> which you confeſſe is not righteouſneſſe, and truly as in a proper ſenſe, ſo it ſaith <hi>righteouſneſſe is imputed,</hi> which is alſo againſt your aſſertion that it is not righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe indeed, and elſewhere I ſhall make good to be Chriſts; you ſhall not name a third.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is mine, <hi>he is my wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloved, mine, he is the Lord my righteouſneſſe.</hi> Sir, whether you will or no the Lord ſaith it, <hi>this is his name whereby he ſhall be called, The Lord our righteouſneſſe, Jer.</hi> 23. 6.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Faith in a proper ſenſe bringeth not into commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, as your ſelfe, though here you ſay it, elſewhere you deny it, &amp; here you confound righteouſneſſe and juſtification as if they were one; if ſo, why doe you deny it elſewhere? if it be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, indeed it is an effect of righteouſneſſe imputed (ſo is juſtification) the matter, by imputation that by which) Why doe you confound them?</p>
            <p>And here we may ſee what a goodly effect faith hath, and what a bringing into communion you meane, when as you deny communion with Chriſts righteouſneſſe, but in the effect of it, to which after.</p>
            <p n="5">5.

            <p>4. When as you ſay, Mr. <hi>W. inſtances from Scripture, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

            <p>
               <hi>Vlt.</hi> You ſay, <hi>ſome inſtances contradict that deſcription of his according to his owne interpretation, of the phraſe imputing, as that of</hi> Shimei, <hi>Let not my Lord impute iniquity to me, hee doth not (ſaith Mr.</hi> W. <hi>truly but contradictingly to himſelfe) that</hi> David <hi>ſhould not judge his iniquity to be none, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is againſt all reaſon be ſhould ſay, ſtill it ſo ſignifies; and ſo for that of</hi> Job 33. 10. <hi>whence you deduce it, doth alwayes ſo ſignifie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which the anſwer is eaſie.

            <p>When as to ſhew the contrary you inſtance in <hi>Rom. 4. 8. &amp; 2 Cor. 5. 19. Where God is ſaid not to impute ſinne, the meaning is not that God doth not judge a beleever to have ſinne in him, and to judge as it is, but that God abſolving men from guilt and puniſhment, and ſo imputing righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that it is of a full different nature from judging it as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For my part I know not, but when as God imputeth not ſinne, he judgeth as it is, for there is neither guilt nor puniſhment properly ſo called to them that beleeve in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; which is therefore true, becauſe they are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, truly given them and applied by faith, by which as they are accounted righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and are ſo indeed.</p>
            <p>When as you ſay Mr. <hi>Ws. owne tenet ſheweth it, that God imputeth Chriſts righteouſneſſe for the righteouſneſſe we ſhould have performed in our owne perſons, which is not our owne perſonall righteouſneſſe.</hi> You miſſe-report it. <hi>Mr.</hi> Ws. words are, <hi>when God imputeth Chriſts righteouſneſſe to a beleever, he counteth him perfectly righteous by that righteouſnes, and ſo he is indeed.</hi>

            <p>I Anſwer, that I ſhould thinke any thing may truly and properly be ſaid to be the ſame with it ſelfe; neither doe I conceive any thing more truly and properly the ſame then the thing it ſelfe: other things may be like, are not

            <p>That may have a faire account. Legall righteouſneſſe was inherent in <hi>Adam,</hi> as well as in <hi>Chriſt.

            </p>
            <p>1.

               <hi>but according to the neceſſity of every Captive: mention therefore of the world is abſurdly made in particular application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>The righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is not imputed unto us as cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but onely as Subjects thereof.</hi> Bellarmine <hi>therefore moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitly inferreth us to be capable of the name of Redeemers or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours, becauſe we be redeemed and ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our late Learned <hi>Biſhop of Salisbury</hi> anſwereth the ſame argument, and to that part ſaith, <hi>It is a ridiculous inference, for he is a Redeemer and a Saviour, not who receiveth redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and ſalvation, anothers worke imputed unto him; but who performeth redemption and ſalvation by his owne effectuall worke.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50493:35"/>
Therefore we are rightly affirmed redeemed, and ſaved, from the imputation of this righteouſneſſe, but we are called Redeemers by none that are in their right wits. Laſt of all, that alſo is to be conſidered, Chriſts righteouſneſſe, cannot be imputed to this or that beleever according to the whole latitude of its efficacie, but as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one hath need of it. It is not therefore imputed to</hi> Peter a <hi>the generall price of redemption for all, but as the price by which a ſoule in particular is redeemed, and by whoſe merit he in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular is exalted to eternall life. But from ſuch an imputation of this righteouſneſſe, it can neither be gathered that we are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual'y as juſt as Chriſt, nor at all to be called Redeemers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If we looke on the truth of the righteouſneſſe which is imputed</hi>
               <note place="margin">Si veritatem juſtitiae nobis imputatae ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes non minus juſti cenſemur coram Deo ac Chriſtus, nec tamen redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptores. <hi>Luc. Trel. p.</hi> 94.</note> 
               <hi>to us, we are accounted no leſſe juſt before God then Chriſt, and yet we are not Redeemers.</hi> See the place.</p>
            <p>Thus what you oppoſe to imputed righteouſneſſe as abſurdity is oppoſed by <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and the inference ſhewed to be moſt abſurd by the learned <hi>Proteſtants</hi> againſt them, to their Barre you ſtand and muſt make an anſwer. In a word, though every member hath communion with the head Chriſt, and partaketh for, and according to his need, as a member of a naturall body from the naturall head, yet hath he not <hi>Chriſts</hi> merits to give to others, more then a member in the body, ſuppoſe the finger, hath life from the head and heart, to give to the feete and toes: and this you may take as Maſter <hi>Walkers</hi> owne anſwer.</p>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> judging the Apoſtle the beſt interpreter of himſelfe, argueth for a tropicall ſenſe, from <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 26. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where the word <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>So by <hi>Aorobams</hi> beleeving by a <hi>Metalepſis</hi> or double trope the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> doth underſtand <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſtanding in the ſtate of a true beleever united by one ſpirit to <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and having communion of his ſatisfaction and righteouſneſſe, faith comprehending the perfect righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſneſſe and full ſatisfaction of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be accounted to him given to him for righteouſneſſe, or that which makes him righteous.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Mr. <hi>Walkers</hi> intent is not to prove a neceſſity by this argument, but that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> (the beſt expounder of himſelfe) thus uſeth the phraſe in another place in the ſame <hi>Epiſtle</hi> as is here interpreted, that it is not therefore ſo <hi>ſtrange, harſh, and uncouth an expreſſion, and figure of ſpeech, and not to be found in all his writings beſides,</hi> as you charge the figurative interpretation to be.

That the thing imputed by God is properly righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, ſuch as being imputed brings forgiveneſſe of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and covers ſinnes, and ſo maketh the beleever bleſſed. Now there is no righteouſneſſe to be found amongſt all mankinde but <hi>Chriſts</hi> perfect righteouſneſſe and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and that is a perfect propitiation for all ſins, therefore it is the righteouſneſſe which is imputed for juſtification.</p>
            <p>Of this argument you ſay it is <hi>built cleane beſides the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation it claimeth,</hi> and when you prove what you ſay, you ſhall have an anſwer. But to what you anſwer.</p>
            <p>1. You ſay, <hi>That the concluſion Chriſts righteouſneſſe muſt needs be that which is imputed for righteouſneſſe in a proper ſenſe, is diametrally oppoſite unto himſelfe in ſeverall examined paſſages, particularly to that which ſaith faith comprehending in it the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is imputed for him, which differ greatly.</hi>

            <p>1. Though faith and Chriſts righteouſneſſe differ, and<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> are oppoſed diametrally in your ſenſe and acceptation they are ſubordinate in Mr. <hi>Walkers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. And when faith is ſaid to be imputed taking in the the righteouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> You know Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> ſaith faith is imputed in an improper ſenſe, and that Chriſts righteouſneſſe is that which is imputed in a proper ſenſe; that is it w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> alone properly imputed maketh us righteous.</p>
            <p>2. You blame <hi>his underſtanding the Apoſtles phraſe of impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting righteouſnes, v. 6. ſuppoſing a proper pre-exiſtent righteouſneſſe for the matter of ſuch imputation which is one of his miſtakes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, Mr. <hi>Walkers</hi> underſtanding had beene blame worthy, had he ſuppoſed otherwiſe; for a proper perfect righteouſneſſe is neceſſary to make one ſo righteous.</p>

            <p>For anſwer. You muſt prove that forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, &amp;c. are the deſcription of that righteouſneſſe imputed. It is but begged.</p>
            <p>Imputation of righteouſneſſe is not the ſame with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of ſinnes. It is more, it is the cauſe of remiſſion of ſinnes, this an effect of righteouſneſſe imputed. This righteouſneſſe imputed bringeth forgiveneſſe with it, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſinne, making the beleever in that reſpect bleſſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remiſsion of ſinnes is cauſed by perfect righteouſneſſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> confeſſeth Juſtification an effect of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>and Juſtification is indeed the proper and the true effect of righteouſneſſe what way ſoever, that righteouſneſſe is imputed or communicated unto us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, <hi>remiſsion of ſinnes is an effect of Juſtification. Pardon is neither the whole nor any eſſentiall part of Juſtification, but onely a contingent effect of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally you ſay, <hi>Gods imputing righteouſneſſe (in this place) is meant onely his juſtifying of men, or (as Mr. W. p. 10.) a dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with men according as if they were righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is ſo, not in deed, but in the effect thereof: indeed imputation of righteouſneſſe is the cauſe, juſtification the effect thereof. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſaith not ſo, but that it is Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting them righteous, and dealing with them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50493:40"/>
               <hi>it is that which under the name of faith is ſaid to be imputed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You anſwer, <hi>This was for ſubſtance before propounded and anſwered.</hi> To which I, if ſo, repetition will be vaine on both ſides. Let it goe.</p>
            <p>You adde, <hi>Though nothing but the righteouſneſſe or ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Chriſt will ſerve meritoriouſly unto juſtification. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall things doe miniſterially, the Word, the Miniſter, and ſo faith in Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Wr.</hi> is not about inſtrumentals in this argument, but that, which imputed, juſtifieth, which is (ſaith he) by the Scriptures the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>When as you grant <hi>nothing meritoriouſly</hi> ſerving but the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, though we take it in part, yet we muſt have more, it muſt be alſo a formall cauſe, or all one with it; Doctor <hi>Davenant</hi> may teach you to ſpeak out.</p>

            <p>Grant then this meritorious cauſe imputed to juſtifie, it ſatisfieth Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> and ſerveth the turne, elſe not.</p>
            <p>He confeſſeth and contendeth faith an inſtrument by which we have fellowſhip with that righteouſneſſe to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, faith being as the hand receiving and applying the ſame, by which righteouſneſſe it is that we are juſtified, and not faith in a proper ſenſe; it not being the hand that properly maketh rich, but what is received by it: which you cannot indure (with the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi>) though a common Proteſtant expreſſion in this controverſie againſt the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſt</hi> denying alſo the proper ſenſe of faith.</p>
            <p>To omit that faith is not the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt urged, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 19. nor righteouſneſſe in which a man can ſtand before God, be made juſt, ſaid to be <hi>holy and unrepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, and unblamable in Gods ſight, perfected for ever,</hi> as the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50493:41"/>
man is that is juſtified, or otherwiſe then taken in a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſenſe to the object thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 16. Mr. <hi>Ws.</hi> fifth argument is, <hi>That this expoſition is warranted by other places of Scripture, which he proveth out of Pſh. 100. as the onely place:</hi> ſee the place.</p>
            <p>This you bring on the ſtage, and ſay <hi>it hath ſu h a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor on the face of it, that a man cannot tell of what ſhape it is, onely it is evident from his owne words, that here he ſtarts, or rather conjures up a new concluſion as farre differing from what be laboured to conclude, as the Eaſt is from the Weſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Good Sir, if (<hi>by reaſon of the viſor on the face of it) a man cannot tell of what ſhape it is,</hi> how is the latter ſo evident? may not a man queſtion you for the latter, profeſſing the former, that a man cannot tell of what ſhape it is; or are you more? this, and what followeth ſuch a profeſſion muſt be accounted roving.</p>
            <p>But how prove you ſuch a differing new concluſion? <hi>he writes</hi> (ſay you) <hi>that the imputing or accounting of a thing for righteouſneſſe is no more but declaring a man thereby to be righteous, and giving him the teſtimony of righteouſneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you deliver him. I finde it not ſo in his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Copy, and even there his concluſion is what was to be concluded, <hi>therefore this is to be judged the best expoſition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides what he ſpeaketh of declaring is added for far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther explication of what God did, when as he imputed righteouſneſſe to <hi>Phineas</hi> as himſelfe. <hi>God upon this act gave him teſtimony and declared and judged him to be a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man truly juſtified.</hi> But <hi>by this reaſoning</hi> ſay you, <hi>be ſeemeth to imply that a man is not conſtituted or made righteous, or truly and really juſtified by the imputation of Chriſts righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe or ſatisfaction it ſelfe unto him, but onely that be is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be ſuch, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no ſuch implication. That is neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by Gods declaration, for God cannot give teſtimony contrary to what a man is indeed, <hi>God cannot ly, his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is according to truth,</hi> and ſo his teſtimony; the viſor troubleth you. You proceed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Neither doth that Scripture prove that heterogeneall concluſion,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50493:41"/>
it doth not import any teſtimony from God of his perſonall righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe or juſtified eſtate before God, but onely the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the particular act.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely that act did ſhew him (as Mr. <hi>Wr.</hi>) united to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and a partaker of righteouſneſſe by faith, on which <hi>God</hi> gave him teſtimony.</p>
            <p>And I ſuppoſe a righteous act importeth perſonall righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe inherent, which are inſeparable from righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imputed, by which righteouſneſſe imputed, that which is inherent, the acts thereof and perſon are juſtified. From this, not inherent righteouſneſſe or acts thereof, it is that man is perfectly juſt and ſo denominated. And thus Mr. <hi>Wr.</hi> paſſeth to the Confutation of the falſe expoſition made by <hi>Socinus</hi> and other <hi>Heretiques</hi> his diſciples, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Here you charge Mr. <hi>Wr. to be an Heretique maker,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Wr.</hi> may eaſily diſcharge with repetition of the ſame words, and reſolve his making Heretiques into Mr. <hi>John Goodwine</hi> as the maker of an Heretique maker, &amp;c. The truth is, if the interpretation be hereticall (as ſome have ſaid before Mr. <hi>W.</hi> as before) not Mr. <hi>Wr.</hi> but Mr. <hi>John Goodwine,</hi> &amp;c. have made themſelves ſuch by imbracing and broaching the ſame with thoſe Heretiques: and though Mr. <hi>Wotton be dead,</hi> his opinion liveth in his workes and ſuch as follow him. His fall is the greater in this by how much the more he is exalted as a <hi>Cedar in Lebanen.</hi> It is a truth of him and all the Princes of his opinion. That hath beene diſcuſſed already, and we have ſeene Mr. <hi>Wr.</hi> farre from affirming the ſame, deteſting it, conſtantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying you his hand:</p>
            <p>And for your appeale to the <hi>ſtrong ſavour of Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme in the beginning of his fifth argument,</hi> you ſpeake of, you neither there nor here doc ſhew in what that rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe lieth. There, if you remember, it had ſuch a <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iſor on the face of it, that a man cannot tell what the face of it is, or its complexion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Farther you ſay, <hi>none of the 3. &amp;c. conceived or delivered that expoſition that is faith is imputed in a proper ſenſe.</hi> But it is cleare for <hi>Socinus;</hi> he holdeth the proper ſenſe, and ſo
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50493:42"/>
faith imputed. So doth Mr. <hi>Wotton,</hi> you cannot but know it, and it is your <hi>Helena.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now let us come to Mr. <hi>Wr.</hi> his arguments, by which he proveth the ſame, and improveth the falſe expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; they are 7. You doe not ſo much as lay them down or anſwer formally to any one of them.</p>
            <p>All the anſwer you make is by Queſtions, and they are but of ſome things contained in them, ſo that all the reſt is left unqueſtioned and unanſwered. I will not do ſo with your Queſtions. Let us heare, what are they?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. You would know <hi>from what Fountain Mr.</hi> W. <hi>drankee that draught of Divinity, that faith</hi> Rom. 5. 1, 2. <hi>taken in a proper ſenſe, ſhould be a part of our obedience to the morall Law?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You adde, <hi>intire obedience to the whole Law was required of</hi> Adam, <hi>but not to beleeve in Chriſt, the Law not being of faith,</hi> Gal. 3. 12.</p>
            <p>To the firſt I anſwer. That faith which juſtifieth in relation to its object, conſidered as a worke or vertue in a proper ſenſe, is (as is ſuppoſed by ſuch as are learned) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the morall Law. They ſay:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Where the L. requireth me to have no other God, and willeth me to have him to be mine by faith; be willeth me to beleeve in Chriſt, without whom God never offereth himſelfe to be, nor can be mine, by whom it is I beleeve in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>where the argument runneth, I am the Lord thy God, there faith in Chriſt is required, to whom be is firſt a God, and in whom mine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>They take faith in Chriſt to be a ſpeciall part of internall worſhip, ſuch as when I performe it to Chriſt, I performe it not to him alone, but to God, not onely himſelfe, but the other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. He that beleeveth in me, beleeveth not in me, but in him that ſent me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo they <hi>take it that the morall Law is the perfect rule of our worſhip of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I ſuppoſe faith in Chriſt undeniably ſince the fall preſcribed and called for and anſwered by</hi> Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham; <hi>by what? but the morall Law. The Goſpel giveth indeed,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50493:42"/>
but it is the Law that requireth it.</hi> They ſay:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That faith is required in the Law, none ever doubted: faith to all that is written, then to the Goſpel, to God as revealed in Chriſt, the lively faith which worketh by love, which is none but faith in Chriſt; or elſe the dead faith, that which is in the Devils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, <hi>that that Grace is but one, and ſo that it is but the Some faith by which we beleeve in Chriſt and God. Yea that grace, without which other graces required are not. That radicall grace, without which other graces and their workes cannot be ſuch as God requireth, ſuch hope, ſuch love, ſuch feare, ſuch joy, ſuch prayer, ſuch praiſe, as God requireth ſutable to him as a God in covenant and a Father, without which they cannot pleaſe God, neither aime at or attaine Gods ends, ſhould not be excluded; the Law that requireth thoſe graces elſe and their workes, requireth that faith; and that, if faith in Chriſt he not required in the Law, infidelity will not be ſinne, neither can it condemne him that is under the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>the rule of faith, &amp;c. is Gods will contained in his word, and that the manner of worſhip and faith is ordinarily given to the ſecond Commandement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For <hi>Adam in</hi> innocency, there might be a bond on him to beleeve in Chriſt, though not as a <hi>Lambe</hi> and <hi>ſlaine,</hi> but as <hi>onely Mediatour betweene God and man</hi> for <hi>eternall life.</hi> I am ſure he was ever the <hi>beire and Lord of life,</hi> and that <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life was for ever in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An <hi>obedientiall power to beleeve</hi> what ever word or reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of God we ordinarily meet with in orthodox Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, as for obedience to Gods commands ſimply, thoſe, at leaſt ſome, that diſpute the contrary, drinke deeply of <hi>Arminian ſtreames:</hi> had you given us reaſons againſt it, we would have conſidered them.</p>
            <p>When as you ſay <hi>the Law is not of faith,</hi> Gal. 3. 12. It proveth not that faith in a proper ſenſe is not required in the Law, neither neede I to finde out the true ſenſe, it not being to purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Our Writers are of this opinion, that faith in Chriſt is in the Law.</p>

            </p>
            <p>To this Mr. <hi>Wolker</hi> is not bound to anſwer, he affirmed it not. But that your opinion, that God counts faith for righteouſneſſe, that is, thinketh, judgeth, and eſteemeth it to be righteouſneſſe in a proper ſenſe, chargeth God with errour and falſhood in his judgement, and ſo is blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt. 5. How Mr.</hi> Walker <hi>proves that the imputation of faith for righteouſneſſe maketh the ſatisfaction of Chriſt and his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect fulfilling of the Law a vaine and needleſſe thing, which Mr.</hi> Goodwine <hi>conceiveth it eſtabliſheth both the one and the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. I anſwer. This, if not proved, yet leaveth the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in force to that part, <hi>viz.</hi> that it denieth the meanes whereby God is revealed to be infinitly juſt, mercifull, and wiſe, which he urged, which hath not ſo much as a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to undermine it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Theſe are done by <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Surety, his perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in our nature; in this wiſdome, mercie, and juſtice, are revealed, as Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> and our Church in the <hi>Homily.</hi> With which, though faith in a Relative ſenſe doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, yet in a proper ſenſe, excluding the imputation of the

righteouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to juſtification, it is oppoſed, your ſelfe putting the one with <hi>Arminius</hi> ſay, <hi>and not the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed if faith be that righteouſneſſe or inſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is vaine and void; and if this righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> be it, faith in that ſenſe, (as workes are) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in this matter, and exclude each other.</p>

               <hi>is a reaſon why I may conclude (if yet you will be like our ſelves) you muſt at length come to this, that with</hi> Servetus <hi>and</hi> Socinus, <hi>&amp;c. yee altogether take away the merit or ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction made for us, and ſay Chriſt neither to have brought forth righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to us, nor us to be juſtified by his righteouſneſſe imputed unto us—For to what end is the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, if it hath not in it force of Juſtifying, and if it juſtifie us not?</hi> Which (ſay I) it cannot, if faith in a proper ſenſe be imputed for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>Let the Reader obſerve the argument and proofe of Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> and this anſwer of queſtion (as the reſt) will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare not to be ſatisfactory, but a lying under the burthen rather.</p>

Mr.</hi> G. <hi>conceiveth that inſufficient, becauſe a man having ſinned could not be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by perſonall performance of the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That the righteouſneſſe of Chriſts is ſo truly ours for righteouſneſſe as if we had fulfilled the Law, you bogle not at: our Church is cleare; ſo are learned Writers. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed by faith he and his righteouſneſſe are truly ours.</p>
            <p>2. Your ſuppoſition to be a ſinner and perſonally to performe the Law, is a contradiction, to fulfill it and not; none of Mr. <hi>Wrs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. When as Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> putteth <hi>Chriſts</hi> righteouſneſſe,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50493:44"/>
his meaning is his perfect obedience to the Law, our full debt Active and Paſſive righteouſneſſe, wherein ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for ſinne is infoulded, ſo that the perſon is <hi>wholly faire;</hi> God ſeene to be juſt, mercifull, and wiſe, this is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt. 7. Whether God did not diſpenſe with his juſtice in paſſing by the ſinner, inflicting puniſhment upon the innocent, and whether he will call the one or the other an act of Juſtice? Mr.</hi> G. <hi>conceives that Gods juſtice led him directly to the ſinner to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etute vengeance on him, and that it was his mercy that led him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide from him that deſerved death, to another that had not deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. I anſwer, God was juſt and merciful in our Juſtification by faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as before is largely ſhewed out of the word of <hi>God,</hi> and orthodox Writers; neither can either be denied. It is <hi>freely by grace to declare his righteouſneſſe.</hi> It was an act of juſtice not denying mercy, and an act of mercy not excluding juſtice.</p>
            <p>2. Though juſtice leadeth to the offendor, and not to the innocent party, here it cannot be ſo, the caſe is altened, the <hi>L. Chriſt</hi> cannot be ſaid to be innocent, but as our <hi>Surety</hi> a ſinner, our ſinnes being on his ſcore. He volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily accepted it, and undertooke eternally to give theſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life. So is he propoſed to us ſince the fall by God himſelfe, his taking our nature, doing all righteouſneſſe, and doing for us, proclaime the ſame, that he was a <hi>Surety,</hi> in this name he muſt <hi>fulfill all righteouſneſſe.</hi> He muſt die, <hi>it was his meat and drinke to doe, and he offered up himſelfe. God ſpared not his Sonne,</hi> at his command the <hi>ſword ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>To exact a debt of a <hi>Surety,</hi> willingly giving the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor the hand, and let the principall not able to pay, to go free, is juſtice: mercy indeed, did ſweetly meete in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting a Surety, and giving him, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> accepting the bargaine, and giving himſelfe to be the Surety, whereby that juſtice was ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 8. <hi>What moved Mr. W. to thinke or ſay that thoſe
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50493:45"/>
that hold imputation of faith for righteouſneſſe ſhould deny com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt in his ſatisfaction, when as Mr.</hi> G. <hi>ſtill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth that that faith is ordained by God to bring men into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and fellowſhip with Chriſt in his ſatisfaction, and by vertue of ſuch ordination juſtifieth inſtrumentally, or which is the ſame, is imputed for righteouſneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. He might well ſo thinke of Maſter <hi>Wotton,</hi> who<note place="margin">Quoniam non revera &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prie ſed impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prie, &amp; per ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudinem quandam unu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cum illo corpus efficimus. <hi>De reconcil. p. 16. &amp; p.</hi> 110.</note> 
               <hi>though he acknowledgeth uinon, and that by the Spirit; yet he ſaith we make one body with Chriſt, not indeed, and properly, but improperly, and by a certaine ſimilitude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When as he ſaith it is not <hi>indeed,</hi> he denieth union and communion, which is ſo much the more abſurd, when as yet he confeſſeth it cauſed by <hi>faith</hi> and the <hi>Spirit,</hi> then u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, by which, there cannot be one more reall.</p>
            <p>2. You denying the imputation to our Juſtification, deny union and communion ſo farre, nay, both ſeeing they are inſeperable.</p>
            <p>3. The fellowſhip you affirme is not to fellowſhip with the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, but the effect thereof or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, pardon, which is not all.</p>
            <p>4. When as you ſay <hi>faith juſtifieth inſtrumentally, &amp;c.</hi> yet you deny it as an hand laying hold of and receiving Chriſts righteouſneſſe which juſtifieth, that it ſo juſtifieth as the hand that receiveth money maketh rich, which though it be an ordinary expreſſure of the <hi>Learned,</hi> you ſlighted and rejected in the Pulpit as the <hi>Remonſtrants,</hi> who give it a <hi>nuge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. For my part I ſuſpect your calling it an inſtrument there is ſomewhat under it, for if ſo be that faith be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged an inſtrument indeed, it cannot juſtifie in a proper ſenſe, which may be the reaſon that <hi>Arminius, &amp;c.</hi> deny it, but figuratively.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>No man is ignorant but that by a figure called Metonymia,</hi>

               <hi>by faith correlatively, that is, we are juſtified by that which is correlative to faith, forſooth by the merit of Chriſt to which it is referred, or which faith doth apprehend: for faith and the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Chriſt are correlatives, as the receiver and that which is received. But then we ſpeake rightly, becauſe then faith is underſtood of the formall cauſe of Juſtification: and the ſenſe is, the merit of Chriſt doth juſtifie, not faith. That which is apprehended juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, not the inſtrument apprehending. But juſtification is alſo without rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion rightly given to faith, as to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall cauſe.

            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 9. To your ninth Queſtion. <hi>How your opinion denies the infinite juſtice of God, to ſtand in ſtrength or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſuch a ſatisfaction as Chriſt, God and man, made? when as they conceive no poſſibility of ſuch imputation, but by vertue of ſuch ſatisfaction, nor can they imagine ſuch a faith to be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without ſuppoſing a Mediator, Chriſt God and man, on which it ſhould reſt, who gives it the name and being that it hath. It is true, they deny that the juſtice of God ſimply and abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ſuch a ſatisfaction as Christ God and man made, but on ſuppoſition that God would bring many ſonnes to glory,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50493:46"/>
and ſave what was loſt, they deny it not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Gods juſtice cannot ſtand in ſtrength where men are juſtified by that which is no ſatisfaction to it, faith in a proper ſenſe. And where the ſatisfaction which the Law requires, is not ſo much as imputed to them for their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification.</p>
            <p>2. Infinite juſtice requires ſuch a ſatisfaction as <hi>Chriſt God and man</hi> made, to Juſtification, becauſe in that <hi>God</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth himſelfe juſt, as before.</p>
            <p>3. Imputation of faith by vertue of the ſatisfaction of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is to ſay that <hi>Chriſt</hi> merited that faith ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted (as I conceive) and that <hi>Socinianiſme, Oſterodus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I doe not detract it (Juſtification)</hi>
               <note place="margin">Non detraho illam ſanguini &amp; morti Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti, ſed tribuo illam morti &amp; ſanguini Chriſti, quatenus ſanguis &amp; mors in nobis efficiunt eas res propter quas Deus nos juſtificat, nempe ſidem. <hi>See Sybran. ad Bert. p.</hi> 10.</note> 
               <hi>from the bloud and death of Chriſt, but I give it to the bloud of Chriſt, ſo farre forth as his bloud and death work in us thoſe things for which God doth juſtifie us, forſooth faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Though they cannot imagine a faith imputed, not ſuppoſing a Mediator on whom, yet they deny faith in a Relative ſenſe, taking in the Mediator, to be imputed, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute againſt it for the proper ſenſe, which ſatisfieth not juſtice, but deſtroyeth it, as before.</p>
            <p>5. Gods <hi>bringing many ſonnes to glory,</hi> and to ſave what ſhould be loſt by <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſatisfaction of his juſtice was Gods eternall and immutable purpoſe. The glory of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and mercy Gods maine ends required it; as <hi>Chriſt</hi> did in time, God determined eternally: thus eternall will determined it ſelfe, and to conſider otherwiſe is but the worke of idle braine, there is no reality in the <hi>Lord</hi> to anſwer it.</p>

               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 10. To the tenth queſtion I anſwer, it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth you hold God can and doth by his Soveraigne pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and will, things contrary to his juſtice, in your opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Seeing you teach God can, doth, and will juſtifie men, without ſatisfaction made by the perfect righteoufeſſe of Chriſt their <hi>Surety,</hi> accounted to them, putting faith in a proper ſenſe, a created imperfect grace Imputed for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50493:46"/>
which cannot ſatisfie juſtice, which cannot ſtand with or declare the ſame, ſo that either Gods end is not <hi>to declare his righteouſneſſe</hi> againſt the Apoſtle in juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 26. or elſe you deſtroy that end, and ſo eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh ſuch a ſoveraigne power and will.</p>

               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 11. And to the eleventh, to accept for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe that which is not ſo according to Gods Law, is contrary to <hi>juſtice,</hi> ſeeing it is a juſtification of the <hi>wicked, abomination to the Lord;</hi> the <hi>holding of a guilty perſon innocent,</hi> which the Lord will not doe; being the <hi>Judge</hi> of <hi>all the world be cannot doe, doing right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When as God accepts Chriſts righteouſneſſe for the debt of a beleever, and imputeth it to him, that righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is not the beleevers perſonall righteouſneſſe, that is righteouſneſſe performed in his owne perſon, ſo <hi>no fleſh living can be juſtified in Gods ſight;</hi> but the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt his <hi>Surety,</hi> his <hi>Head,</hi> his by reall union and communion, as if it were perſonall righteouſneſſe: the <hi>Sureties</hi> payment of a debt for the principall is all one as if the principall did himſelfe make ſatisfaction to the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor.</p>

               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 13. To the thirteenth, the inſufficiency of Chriſts righteouſneſſe and ſatisfaction for all, even Scripture ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency is there denied where <hi>Chriſts righteouſneſſe is denied to fit all men and women of all callings and conditions,</hi> and counted <hi>an unreaſonable thing, as that one garment ſhould fit all ſtatures and proportions of bodies, or the ſame ſhooe all feete of all ſizes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And why Sir, ſhould not that fit all which is the Sonne of Gods <hi>fulfilling all righteouſneſſe?</hi> when as by it all are perfectly righteous that beleeve, men, women, of all ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and conditions.</p>
            <p>Either it fitteth all, ſo that all ſorts are perfectly righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous by it applied alone, or none, which might have been ſaid plainly; or being ſo, righteous, they are ſo by ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what elſe, and you muſt name that. What for men and women of all ſorts, of all callings and conditions?</p>
            <p>I thought there had been <hi>neither male nor female,</hi> but <hi>alone in Chriſt;</hi> and that it were vaine elſe for all to put him on in Baptiſme ſacramentally, and by beleeving really, that the precept was vaine (and impoſſible to ſome) that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth it.</p>
            <p>Did we grant faith in a proper ſenſe, that righteouſnes, or imputed for it, that would ſerve all, fit all in your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, belike; or elſe it is liable to the ſame exception, <hi>the bride is arraied with it,</hi> and the Builder and Maker of it both maketh it and judgeth it fit: no matter for ſuch curious ſpeculators elſe.</p>

            <p>Where alſo they ſay, and prove by places brought to that purpoſe, that <hi>the</hi> Socinians <hi>deny faith in God and Chriſt to be the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That alſo muſt be conſidered, where you ſay <hi>by workes, (the falſe way) is not meant whatſoever may in any reſpect be ſaid to be done by a man himſelfe, if any thing ſhould be upon any conſideration required of him in reference to his juſtification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I ſay, it is true in the Proteſtant ſenſe, taking faith in a Relative ſenſe; I, and of all graces elſe as Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and preſent with the faith that juſtifieth, for it is not alone when it juſtifieth, though it alone juſtifieth, (as the Learned acknowledge) but then, that any thing but faith as an inſtrument receiving, ſhould have efficience, that there ſhould be ſomewhat, any thing, faith it ſelfe, accepted of <hi>God</hi> inſtead of the workes of the Law, to juſtification, I am afraid to acknowledge. Truely <hi>Sir</hi> there is more in this firſt heape then I was aware of at firſt ſight, and I think you muſt to worke againe.</p>
            <p>Another thing Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> excepteth againſt, is that you ſay. <hi>God doth not require of us the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt to Juſtification, this be required of Chriſt himſelfe.</hi> To which you ſay, <hi>that before Mr.</hi> W. <hi>ſheweth the groſſeneſſe of this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, himſelfe drops two groſſe errours indeed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What is the firſt? <hi>That (ſay you) God requireth nothing of us to Juſtification, when as it is notoriouſly knowne that he threatens damnation except we beleeve; and to credit his ſaying, he cites,</hi> Rom. 3. 24. <hi>whereas the verſe following quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwes it, wherein the condition of faith is expreſſely men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, here is no errour if you will underſtand Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> his meaning is, he required no workes or doing of ours for it, it being done freely by <hi>grace in Chriſt,</hi> which grace will not ſtand with our workes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:50493:60"/>Neither doth he deny faith required as a condition in a ſenſe, Relatively, or as the hand and inſtrument recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Chriſts righteouſneſſe to juſtification. He denieth it as our worke, for, or inſtead of the righteouſneſſe of the Law to juſtification.</p>
            <p>When you ſay, <hi>God threatneth damnation, except we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,</hi> is it not a ſinne? a tranſgreſſion of the Law? Is it not the Law's to miniſter death? It ſeemeth this faith is therefore required in the Law. You goe on.</p>
            <p>He (ſay you) <hi>drops a ſecond errour more groſſe then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, ſaying, that faith is a qualification to us for the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, applying, and injoying Chriſts righteouſneſſe, that is, faith is a qualification to us for beleeving; for what is the receiving, applying, and injoying the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, but beleeving as before obſerved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Here you ſee Mr. <hi>W.</hi> excludes not faith beleeving as a qualification, which was your late charge, your ſelfe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To ſay that a man may receive, that is, apply and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the righteouſneſſe, which receiving is beleeving, he muſt be qualified, is no more then to ſay, he muſt have a power that he may doe; be habitually diſpoſed, that he may act, which is ſo farre from being an errour, that it is impoſſible that a man ſhould beleeve, receive, or apply in this kind without faith.</p>
            <p>And with your leave <hi>Sir,</hi> faith in a proper ſenſe qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, but as inſtrumentall, as an hand it receiveth and injoyeth, it bringeth home treaſure which inricheth; the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt which juſtifieth. It is ſo far from oppoſition to the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt in juſtification, which is your tenet.</p>
            <p>Finally, here is more granted to faith by you, then an aſſent, or work of the underſtanding, which is of ſome uſe.</p>
            <p>But let us returne to what Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> taxed, that is, You ſaid, <hi>God required not of us the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt for juſtification;</hi> this (you ſay) <hi>Mr.</hi> Walker <hi>cals a groſſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and inſtead of proofe, complaineth of it as an harſh, unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:50493:60"/>
and abſurd phraſe: and that to juſtifie his complaint, he ſaith God requires not the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, but of Chriſt himſelfe, implying he had need.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. I anſwer, Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> in all chargeth you here but with one groſſe errour, and if that be made good it is enough.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is true, he calleth Gods requiring of us the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of Chriſt for juſtification, abſurd, &amp;c. which he ſheweth, and you touch not: ſee the place.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I ſuppoſe what you inferre as his proofe thereof is not ſo, nor to that end intended, but a plaine paſſing to it (as he conceived) a groſſe errour, and ſo your <hi>jeſts p. 70. faile, are but irrelativeneſſe and impertinencies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I come to the maine thing (not having your writing, I muſt ſpeake to it as it is related) What if one ſhould contradict your poſition, and ſay, God requires of us the righteouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to juſtification? you ſay <hi>he requires faith,</hi> and <hi>faith in Chriſt, a beleeving, which is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, applying, and injoying.</hi> Why may I not put in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject received, applied, and injoyed, the righteouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to juſtifie me? Is it not a receiving him, an apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, and injoying him, to juſtification and ſalvation? I hope it is with his righteouſneſſe. He that threatneth damnation for not receiving, applying, and injoying <hi>Chriſt,</hi> requires of me receiving <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe alſo to juſtification, as he requireth that I be juſt, and revealeth him our righteouſneſſe, he requireth applying and receiving him, putting him on for juſtification; that, or perfectly to performe the Law, which being impoſſible it is that; and the Scripture ſaith that <hi>by the obedience of one I am conſtituted righteous,</hi> Rom. 5. 19.</p>
            <p>But to the buſineſſe, <hi>God required not of us the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt for juſtification. This he required of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: ſo you.</hi> This laſt he calleth an errour indeed, There he putteth an Accent. This ſaith Mr. <hi>Wr. implieth Chriſt had need of juſtification, and was bound to fulfill the Law for himſelfe, and ſavoureth of</hi> Socinian <hi>and</hi> Samoſatenian <hi>hereſie, which denies Chriſts Godhead; for if Chriſts humane nature being
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:50493:61"/>
from the firſt conception moſt pure, upright, and holy, was perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally united to his Godhead, and ſo the Sonne of God, and heire of all things; Who can doubt but in himſelfe he was worthy of all glory, at Gods right hand from his birth: as his taking of our nature upon him, was altogether for us: ſo his infirmities, ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, death, and continuance on earth for the performance of all righteouſneſſe and obedience to the whole Law was for us, and for all the elect, who of old beleeved in him to come for them, who doe now beleeve in him exalted to glory according to his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. To think or ſay that he had need to juſtifie himſelfe, and to merit by his righteouſneſſe the ſtate of glory, is in effect to deny he was God, infinitely worthy of all glory as he was the onely begotten Sonne of God and Heire of all things.</hi> Thus Mr. <hi>Walker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we muſt lay aſide <hi>laughing irrelativeneſſe and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What ſay you to this? It ſeemeth a groſſe errour by what is ſaid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I could I conceive</hi> (ſay you) <hi>put ſome Queries to him, that would a little trouble him to make good the truth thereof in a poſitive way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſhould firſt anſwer, then propoſe Queries. Your anſwer by Queries is but a wile, tergiverſation. I will be plaine in anſwering you, as I ſhall be able.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>How he can prove that Chriſt had no need of juſtification?</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Quere.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Surely Chriſt was a juſtified or righteous perſon in the ſight of</hi>

               </note> 
               <hi>God, this justification was not ſuperfiuous, or no wiſe uſefull to him; and what is not ſuperfluous, we men of the lower forme of learning judge to be ſome wayes needfull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Mr.</hi> Walker anſwereth, <hi>if juſtification be forgiveneſſe and pardon of ſinne onely,</hi> (as you elſewhere ſay) <hi>when as he is ſaid to have need of juſtification, he is infoulded a ſinner, to have need of remiſſion of ſinnes.</hi> Which if it be too too groſſe, by it may be proved that he needed not juſtification for himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Yea, to be in need of forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, and ſo righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous a perſon as you ſpeake, are <hi>pugnantia ſecum frontibus adverſis,</hi> a contradiction.</p>
            <p>But it ſeemeth as he was a righteous perſon, that was not
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:50493:61"/>
               <hi>ſuperfluous, therefore ſome waies needfull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You muſt ſay for <hi>himſelfe.</hi> But he needed it not for himſelfe being <hi>Gods Sonne, God bleſſed for ever,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſor from the firſt moment of his conception by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall union with the <hi>holy Ghoſt.</hi> It was needfull then for <hi>us.</hi> He was our <hi>Surety,</hi> and in that reſpect they might be needfull for <hi>us,</hi> though not for <hi>himſelfe</hi> elſe.</p>

            <p>Neither doth it follow which you ſay, <hi>if Mr.</hi> Walker <hi>had in this worke his ſcope to diſcharge his conſcience, and the benefit of others, that Chriſts ſcope in obedience was his glory as well as mans good;</hi> ſeeing he hath that glory as Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſor before his obedience, when as a faithfull Miniſters diſcharge of conſcience by a worke of this nature, cannot be but by this worke, when the worke is done, conſcience diſchargeth it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>When as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, <hi>that the worke of our redemption was, opus aeque noſtrum ac ſuum ut angelorum;</hi> there may be truth in it in divers reſpects. He ſaith it not with reſpect to his owne redemption or juſtification, and ſo not to your purpoſe.</p>
            <p>You ſay <hi>it would coſt him many of his thoughts and much of</hi>

               <hi>his learning to give a ſufficient and cleare account, how it ſhould any way intrench or ſo much as looke towards the deniall of Chriſts Godhead to conceive that Chriſt might he bound to fulfill the righteouſneſſe of the Law for himſelfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, for Chriſt to be bound to fulfill that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, for himſelfe his juſtification as you before, is to imply him a ſinner, and ſo to deny him <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is alſo to imply him vainely bufied; living and injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life eternall being the fountaine thereof, to doe that he may live, and ſo to deny him to be that fountaine, and to be that perſon that is <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>You conceive it is farre more dangerouſly to ſhake the truth</hi>

               <hi>of his humanity to deny that he was no waies bound to keepe the Law for himſelfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I conceive no danger in it, for being abſolutely righteous from the firſt moment, and ſo not to need obedience or doing for himſelfe, is ſo far from denying humane nature, that it ſetteth it forth moſt glorious: as it doth ſtand with humane nature to be perfect in glory, though then it worketh not to that end; ſo doth it in Chriſts humane nature, to be perfectly righteous, though he never doth one worke to that end.</p>
            <p>And Mr. <hi>W.</hi> intreateth you to tell him <hi>whether you now deny Chriſt to be true man, when as ſitting at Gods right hand he is not bound to obey the Law, and dy, as he did on earth?</hi> So that it is not to be compared, in the kind, with the errour of the Ubiquitary.</p>
            <p>You ſay, <hi>It is marvellous to me that he being the ſeed of the Woman, by the Law of his Creation ſhould not be bound to keepe that Law which both the man and the woman ſtood bound to keep in their innocency.</hi>

            <p>And now let us to the <hi>bottome of this heape</hi> (as you ſpeak) frothy words ſhall not ſtay me. Here you are charged to ſay, <hi>that if the Apoſtle had ſaid they muſt be juſtified by Chriſt, or by the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, this had beene rather to caſt a ſnare upon them, then to have opened a doore of life and ſalvation, for which be (Mr.</hi> W.) <hi>curſeth with Anathema mara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natha,

            <p>To this you anſwer, <hi>he keepeth back part of your words, and ſupply them thus. To have ſaid they muſt be juſtified by Chriſt or Chriſts righteouſneſſe, and with all not to have plainely ſignified what God requireth of them, and will accept at their hand, to give them part and followſhip in that righteouſneſſe or juſtification, had beene rather to have caſt a ſnare upon them, then to have opened a doore of life and ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>
               <hi>That the Relative ſenſe fathers upon the Apoſtle an harſh and uncouth expreſſion often uſed without explaining himſelfe, when he ſaith faith is imputed to righteouſneſſe, and meaneth Chriſts righteouſneſſe is imputed, which is rather to conceale then reveale it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this the anſwer is.</p>
            <p>It is no harſh, ſtrange, or uncouth expreſſure to uſe a<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> figure of ſpeech, and to meane by faith and beleeving, faith with its object, the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, or ſtate of the man, &amp;c. which is ſhewed out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. the foure laſt <hi>verſ.</hi> by <hi>Beza's</hi> interpretation.</p>

            <p>A third exception is, that you ſay <hi>the Apoſtle uſeth the phraſe of faith, &amp;c. without either explaining himſelfe or chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging

               <hi>That faith which is imputed is his before imputation, which cannot be ſaid of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, that it is a mans before it be imputed, at leaſt in order of nature, though not in time; therefore by faith to be imputed cannot be meant the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of Chriſt.</hi>

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:50493:71"/>
of Chriſt which faith layeth hold on and applieth, by that the promiſe was made. And why ſhall we not thinke his faith then built on that righteouſneſſe? You will not queſtion but we have all for <hi>Chriſts ſake,</hi> his righteouſneſſe ſake and merit, they muſt be imputed, and we by faith have fellowſhip with them, or never have benefit.</p>
            <p>4. Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> doth thinke Chriſts Paſſive righteouſnes to be obedience to the <hi>Law,</hi> that which the Law exacted of us, and we being inſolvent of our <hi>Surety,</hi> and that you cannot eſcape by calling it ſatisfaction to <hi>God,</hi> not to the Law, ſeeing it was <hi>Gods</hi> Law; and in ſatisfying <hi>God</hi> his Law muſt be ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>To your demand. <hi>Doth it follow (though a man cannot ſeparate the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt from Chriſt himſelfe in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving) that the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt muſt needs be the object of faith as juſtifying?</hi> And adde, <hi>much leſſe doth it follow that this righteouſneſſe of Chriſt muſt needs be ſignified by this word God, or by the promiſe of God concerning Chriſt, which himſelfe granteth to have beene the object of faith, as juſtifying.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, it is ſutable to reaſon to pitch on the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in matter of juſtification, ſeeing without righteouſneſſe there is no juſtification, and by righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, what ever it be, there muſt be juſtification, of which before.

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. I anſwer, firſt, in this expreſſure added, you change the concluſion. It was never Mr. <hi>Walkers</hi> meaning by faiths object to ſtand on, alone, <hi>Chriſts</hi> Active obedience, but both Active and Paſſive obedience.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When you exclude this, it ſeemeth you allow that which is Paſſive to be the object. So that faith may be in that and <hi>him that quickneth the dead;</hi> the other inſeparable part muſt not be excluded.</p>
            <p n="3">3.

            <p>The Apoſtle ſaith <hi>the ſpirit is life becauſe of righteouſneſſe, Rom.</hi> 8. 10. which life is without queſtion (though I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude not life ſimply) <hi>the quickning of the dead,</hi> as in the next, v. by righteouſneſſe, <hi>I take imputed righteouſneſſe meant;</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Neither is there oppoſition here, but ſubordination, betweene Chriſt and God and life and faith in Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>Neither are theſe effects of two faiths, faiths of adifferent kind, but of the ſame, there is <hi>but one faith,</hi> by which, as I beleeve in <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his righteouſneſſe, ſo in <hi>God,</hi> as he is in <hi>Chriſt</hi> for <hi>bleſſedneſſe</hi> ſimply, the <hi>remiſſion of ſinnes, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the body, and everlaſting life;</hi> the naming of one excludeth not, but neceſſarily implyeth all the reſt.</p>
            <p>And though Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> (as you conceive) <hi>Reads not Chriſts lying three dayes and three nights in the grave, any where
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:50493:72"/>
called faith, or ſignified by that expreſſion,</hi> yet I ſuppoſe I read the <hi>Goſpel to be called faith,</hi> and if that you mention be Goſpel, it muſt be called faith, infolded under that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. I am ſure faith by which I beleeve remiſſion of ſinnes, reſurrection of the body, and everlaſting life, to be faith in God through Chriſt ſatisfying, obedient <hi>even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till death,</hi> continuing Gods ſet <hi>time in the ſtate of the dead, for us,</hi> our juſtification and pardon, yea, ſalvation, to the glory not onely of free grace, but exact juſtice, and doe you conſider the ſame.</p>
            <p>Abrahams <hi>faith imputed to him, was ſuch a faith where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi>
               <note place="margin">Arg. 5. Sect. 22.</note> 
               <hi>he was not weake, nor doubted of Gods promiſe,</hi> verſ. 19. &amp; 20. <hi>This can be no deſcription of Chriſts righteouſneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, though this be no deſcription of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Chriſt, yet <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith imputed might be a ſtrong faith in the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, and this makes nothing againſt the Relative conſideration of faith: what ever the degree of faith is, the object is the ſame, nay the ſtronger the faith is, the more is a man united to Chriſt, the greater is his communion with Chriſt and fellowſhip with God, and ſo is his hold faſt of righteouſneſſe, and ſo his peace and comfort. So that this hindereth not, but righteouſneſſe under the notion of faith, may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted.</p>
            <p>When you ſay <hi>the queſtion is not whether</hi> Abraham <hi>had communion with Chriſt in his righteouſneſſe or no, either more full or leſſe full; but whether what is here affirmed of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams <hi>faith, can be applied to the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, and be conceived as ſpoken of that.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, it can be applyed to the righteouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and thence <hi>Abrahams</hi> communion with <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his righteouſneſſe, in that full manner faith being ſo full and ſtrong.</p>
            <p>When you demand, <hi>Was that faith whereby</hi> Abraham<note place="margin">P. 85.</note> 
               <hi>doubted not of Gods promiſe, the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, it was the ſame faith by which he apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the righteouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by which hee beleeved the promiſe, and in God: What was that promiſe of but
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:50493:73"/>
the <hi>ſeed,</hi> Chriſt and his <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> and <hi>bleſſedneſſe</hi> in and by the ſame?</p>
            <p>You ſay <hi>your Antagoniſt ſtarteth a new queſtion, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member not you ever met withall from the Pen or mouth of any Divine,</hi> viz. <hi>Degrees in Juſtification, as if he held becauſe</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams <hi>faith was ſtronger, it had fuller communion with Chriſt in his righteouſneſſe then other beleevers have, and ſo muſt needs be more juſtified, and conſequently others juſtification un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Then there is ſomewhat you never heard of, I have betweene two famous and godly Divines in my time, though I approve not that Juſtification hath degrees. It is none of Mr. <hi>Walkers,</hi> there may be, and are degrees of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and communion with Chriſt, and ſo of faith, by which neither of theſe I ſuppoſe are here perfect. It followeth not of Juſtification or righteouſneſſe, ſeeing every one is <hi>perfected for ever, wholly faire, compleate. Mr. Walkers</hi> aime is no more then this, that he more ſtrongly applied it, that his a apprehenſion was ſtronger, and that he had more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible communion with him in his righteouſneſſe.

               <hi>as our faith goeth forward, and ſo much as in this knowledge it profiteth, the righteouſneſſe of God together increaſeth in us, and after a manner its poſſeſsion is eſtabliſhed.</hi> Let the laſt phraſe explaine the firſt, that of increaſing, and what is ſaid in my poor opinion is ſafe.</p>
            <p>This your argument I read urged by that <hi>Prince of the Arminian band, Bertius, p.</hi> 135. where it is anſwered by <hi>Lubbertus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Faith imputed to</hi> Abraham <hi>was that by which he was aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, though <hi>Chriſts</hi> righteouſneſſe be not capable of ſuch deſcription, that by it <hi>Abraham</hi> was fully aſſured, yet faith which apprehended the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, was, it ſeemeth it was of its nature, aſſurance is oppoſed to doubt, as by faith he received it, he as a reaſonable and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:50493:73"/>
underſtanding agent did it, and knew the ſame, by faith he was perſwaded and aſſured of the ſame, and ſo of <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Chriſt</hi> as revealed, of the promiſe in which God appeared to him <hi>Almighty,</hi> ingaging power for the ſame. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing added, let your argument and Mr. <hi>Walkers</hi> anſwer be turned looſe together, and ſtand or fall.</p>
            <p>For his <hi>ill-ſounding phraſe or two, at beſt, deſerving rods, Scorpions:</hi> Let it be tried, the firſt is the repetition of the expreſſure cenſured in the former anſwer, to which all I will ſay is, let what is ſaid by you and anſwered, be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned looſe.</p>
            <p>But he ſaith, <hi>the more</hi> Abraham <hi>reſted on Gods power, the more juſtly did God count him a righteous man and impute</hi>
               <note place="margin">G.</note> 
               <hi>Chriſts righteouſneſſe to him; which implies God doth with leſſe juſtice impute the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt to a ſtrong faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, more juſtly may be conſidered in regard of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion or manifeſtation of it to us, for if it appeare juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be done where the faith is weake, where it is ſtrong the appeareance is more cleare.

               <hi>That faith that is imputed, is beleeving in him who raiſed</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, your aſſumption and concluſion (which is a common fault) are laid downe onely of the righteouſnes of Chriſt, not of faith, whereas, what you are to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, is faith in a Relativeſenſe, and taking in Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe, which had you done, the anſwer had beene eaſie. This faith taking in <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is faith in <hi>God which raiſed up the Lord Chriſt from the dead,</hi> the ſame faith that beleeveth in Chriſt and his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, beleeveth <hi>in God that raiſed up Chriſt,</hi> ſo is it laid downe, 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 1. 21. upon it our juſtification dependeth; and if it <hi>were not,</hi> the Apoſtle ſaith our <hi>faith is vaine,</hi> and <hi>we are yet in our ſinnes.</hi> Chriſts Reſurrection ſuppoſeth him fully ſatisfying by obedience, even <hi>untill death,</hi> acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

            </p>
            <p>Here is ſweet harmony, I will leave this alſo to any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable judgement.</p>

            <p>To this I will firſt take the boldneſſe to anſwer, and then conſider of the matter as betweene you and Mr <hi>Walker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. I anſwer the point of Imputation is not onely han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled in this Scripture, it is handled, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 6. and then <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. which are the foundations of what the Apoſtle here doth concerning the ſame, and after, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 6.</p>

               <hi>To be made juſt by the juſtice of another, is to be juſt by imputation, it being not poſſible for any man to be juſt by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers juſtice, but by imputation, ſaith Mr.</hi> Bradſhaw. So is <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne ours, ſo is our ſinne <hi>Chriſts</hi> righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe ours by imputation, as all our Divines.</p>
            <p>Now by the foundation judge of your ſuperſtructives.</p>
            <p>I adde, this ſpeech is a diſtinct and plaine ſpeech, which appeareth by the unanimous judgement of all reformed Writers (but you Mr. <hi>Wotton, Arminius, &amp;c.</hi>) againſt the Papiſts, who ſtumble at Chriſts righteouſneſſe, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh their owne.</p>
            <p>As alſo by all places of Scripture wherein the effects gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to faith that juſtifieth, are given to it in reſpect of its relation to Chriſt, as his proper effects to faith meerely as an inſtrument cauſing union and fellowſhip with him by whom they are effected.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:50493:75"/>Your interpretation is a meere ſtumbling blocke, and deſtroyer of comfort. This a principall foundation of comfort. <hi>The kernell of the Goſpel and head of conſolation,</hi> as Junius. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> judged it ſo when <hi>as he accounted all as dung, and would be found not having his owne righteouſneſſe,</hi> therefore not faith in a proper ſenſe, his, and a kind of righteouſneſſe, <hi>but that which is by faith.</hi> I will finiſh this, making it my prayer, which Doctor <hi>Prideaux</hi> did.</p>

            <p>But it is meete you ſhould be heard.</p>
            <p>You ſay, <hi>to this Mr.</hi> Walker <hi>anſwereth mum.</hi> Let the Reader ſee there, and in his laſt booke, and judge if his anſwer be <hi>mum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You goe on. <hi>Onely he gravely inſtructeth us, that it is more comfortable to us for to reſt on Chriſts righteouſneſſe, &amp;c. then to build on faith, which in the beſt is mingled and stained with many doubts often times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely this is geave adviſe, though you jeſt, you may finde it one day as ſome <hi>Papiſts</hi> have dying, what ever you doe in diſpute, when <hi>as your ſoule ſhall be ready to take its flight from your body,</hi> and that to appeare before Gods tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall. It will wiſh it may (and I pray it may) appeare, nay it muſt appeare in, clothed with this righteouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> imputed by God, applied by faith, if then it hath comfort: <hi>in, agone quanti Papiſtis?</hi> Papiſts then eſteeme of this.</p>
            <p>You goe on relating what Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſaith, <hi>viz. Therefore the Apoſtle doubtleſſe intends Chriſts righteouſneſſe, and ſo be doth expreſſe in plaine words (to another purpoſe)</hi> c. 5. 19. 8. 4. &amp; 10.4.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:50493:75"/>I anſwer, thoſe words to another purpoſe, are your own words, in good time it ſhall be tried.</p>
            <p>Theſe are more then <hi>mum,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle plainly expreſſeth that faith imputed, is called righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe imputed by thoſe texts, <hi>verſ. 6. &amp; 11.</hi> It had beene fairer for you to have anſwered <hi>mum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againſt part of this (you ſay) Mr. <hi>Walker maketh an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition betweene things of the moſt direct and eſſentiall ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination that can be, and which doe inſeparably involve one the other, reſting on Chriſts righteouſneſſe, and building on faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. I anſwer. If Mr <hi>Walker</hi> did doe ſo, he failed as you in all your arguments, or moſt of them. Your fault was to make oppoſition betweene thoſe things which are ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate, as before.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is none of Mr. <hi>Walkers</hi> fault, he doth not make oppoſition between e faith and Chriſts righteouſneſſe. It is your ſelfe in ſtating the queſtion. You ſay, <hi>faith in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſenſe is imputed, and not the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt:</hi> as a worke in a proper ſenſe, you oppoſe it, and it is indeed oppoſed to the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, ſo there is no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination. It is true of the figurative ſenſe you diſpute againſt, that faith involveth the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt in this place overthroweth your cauſe; you muſt be behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for an interpretation here to your friends the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> or you are gone.</p>
            <p>You ſay <hi>it is impoſſible that a man ſhould not build on faith, that doth not reſt on Chriſts righteouſneſſe, that is, the ſatisfaction which he hath made, becauſe faith is a reſting on this ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and ſo a reſting on Chriſts righteouſneſſe, includes a building on faith; for who can reſt on this righteouſneſſe, except he beleeves that ſuch a reſting as this will ſtand him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Here you grant faith a reſting on Chriſts rightcouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. It is true, the faith that receiveth and applieth the ſame, cleaveth and adhereth to it and reſteth on it, then is it not an affent alone, or worke of the underſtanding: this eſtabliſheth our Relative ſenſe.</p>
            <p>That other, building on faith, and that by on other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50493:76"/>
it is but a Caſtle in the aire; at beſt it is but an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent or beliefe which the Devill hath, who beleeveth, <hi>that he that beleeveth in Chriſt ſhall be ſaved.</hi> It is a beleeving in abeleeving, which in your ſenſe is a worke, which is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to <hi>Chriſts</hi> righteouſneſſe in juſtification by your doctrine. For the eſtabliſhing the one, you deny the other, and ſo deſtroy ſubordination. It is ſafeſt to reſt only on that <hi>Rocke Chriſt,</hi> there is <hi>no other foundation;</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> did ſo, When as <hi>he would be found not having his owne righteouſnet,</hi> as faith in a proper ſenſe, ſuch as it is.</p>
            <p>But you ſay. <hi>Sure I am that</hi> Paul <hi>built upon faith for juſtification as well as on the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt</hi> (as Maſter <hi>Walkers beloved phraſe is) though in a different manner (which hath beene formerly explained, when be ſaid we know that a man is not juſtified by the workes of the Law, but by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt, and as Chriſt ſpeaketh concerning himſelfe,</hi> John 12. 44. <hi>He that beleeveth in me, beleeveth not in me, but in him that ſent me, that is, not ſo much in me, as in him that ſent me.</hi> So may it be ſaid, he that <hi>buildeth on faith, buildeth not on faith, but on the truth and faithfulnes of him who hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed forgivenes of ſinnes and ſalvation to him that beleeveth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Let the Reader note, how you ſpeaking of building (for juſtification on faith and on the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt) the former is currant, the other Mr. <hi>Walkers</hi> belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved phraſe; building on the righteouſneſſe is Mr. <hi>Walkers</hi> phraſe; would a man thinke this man a Chriſtian that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth this ſo jeeringly propoſed, or that there were ſuch a direct and eſſentiall ſubordination as was aſſerted but now, and ſuch an inſeparable involution? ſurely it would raiſe much doubt. It is very offenſive to me, and I conceive it much more to God and Chriſt, no marvell that eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith in a proper ſenſe you ſay and not the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Doe you not bring in <hi>Paul</hi> building on two oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite foundations according to your doctrine? a work and Chriſt? the errour he refuteth to the <hi>Rom.</hi> and <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whether he be not brought in equally building on
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:50493:76"/>
faith and Chriſt? your phraſe is <hi>as well,</hi> whether it agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> ſpirit, who would be <hi>found in him, not having his owne righteouſneſſe?</hi> which faith is in yourſenſe, <hi>but that which is by faith</hi> which it receiveth. Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> words that he beleeved in <hi>Chriſt, that he might be juſtified</hi> by faith of Chriſt, are no more then this, that he beleeved in Chriſt, that ſo by that faith in Chriſt he might be juſtified; knowing that (not workes) the onely way, here is no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving by beleeving on beleeving, his building by belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving is in Jeſus Chriſt, which is no other then beleeving in him for juſtification. By that very place faith as a worke is excluded by Saint <hi>Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

               <hi>in the 3. c. will explaine, that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the bleſſing of</hi> Abraham <hi>by faith.

            <p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:50493:77"/>It is not ſo of faith in a proper ſenſe, your faith.</p>
            <p>There is ſomewhat conſiderable yet, and that is the ſubordination here ſpoken of, eſpecially as in the cited text, <hi>John</hi> 12. 44. he that beleeveth in me, beleeveth not in me, but in him that ſent me. And I intreat you to ponder.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whether faith in Chriſt the Mediatour and <hi>God</hi> be not the ſame, and in the morall Law as faith in God, ſurely either both or neither are by this text, that ſticketh you ſee in my ſtomach.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it is not incongruous that the ſame faith which laieth hold on Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe, ſhould lay hold on God alſo, it is <hi>in him, and him that ſent him;</hi> him as revealed, <hi>God,</hi> as <hi>Rom. 4. a quickner of the dead, able, raiſing up Chriſt.</hi> What then becommeth of thoſe arguments you make to exclude Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe from faith imputed to <hi>Abraham?</hi> It ſeemeth theſe may conſiſt, there is a ſubordination and involution of <hi>God</hi> as in Chriſt, in faith in <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may occaſion other thoughts to put the Crowne on Chriſts head, to deny it to faith in a proper ſenſe as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, in the point of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
            <p>You ſay, <hi>for the mixture or ſtaining of faith with many doubtings, this is no conſideration at all, to detaine or keepe a man from building upon it, if it be faith unfeigned and true, becauſe there is the ſame juſtification and ſalvation promiſed to the weakeſt faith and to the ſtrongeſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If faith were taken in a Relative ſenſe, it might be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, becauſe of the object, the righteouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> here is perfect righteouſneſſe, all the Law requireth, <hi>he being the end of the Law for righteouſneſſe to a beleever;</hi> take both, you have the condition of the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> no matter for ſtrength or weakneſſe of faith in the point of Juſtification.</p>
            <p>It is not ſo for faith in a proper ſenſe, not involving, but excluding the righteouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have nothing to object to Gods juſt judgement; gratuide acceptilation of faith, for the perfect obedience
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:50493:77"/>
of the Law, in a proper ſenſe, that Arminian brat deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Gods juſtice: and that faith can no more be accepted then any grace elſe, it is worſe, then to put all graces as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> doe, as our owne teach you, you ſhall never prove it the condition of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why may I not ſay the ſame of Repentance in generall, of love, or the feare of God? theſe as imperfect as they are, juſtifie as well as faith (in your ſenſe) if that be a ſufficient reaſon alone, it is what hath the promiſe, ſee 1 <hi>Jeſ.</hi> 16. 17, 18. faith ſo taken is not the onely condition or quality; all graces, I, workes elſe have their place. It is not faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone that juſtifieth: and how can any of theſe be inſtead of perſonall righteouſneſſe, perfect obedience due to the Law, which is your tenet of this faith.

               <hi>I ſay therefore it is certaine that all are from</hi> Adam <hi>conſtituted really unrighteous, and all the faithfull from Chriſt really righteous. But I deny that to be conſidered of the Apoſtle, who rather inquireth into the firſt cauſes as of that condemnation, ſo of that juſtification, for both according to judgement, he conſidereth it in</hi> Adam <hi>then, yet not peculiar to</hi> Adam, <hi>but appertaining to whole mankind that the ſenſe may be, even then when</hi> Adam <hi>ſinned, whole mankind to be damned or made guilty of diſobedience againſt God, whence alſo in</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine, <hi>originall ſinne is called the puniſhment of the firſt ſin.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In like manner in Chriſt the whole multitude of faithfull, is ſaid to be made or juſtified, or which is the ſame, Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe made to all righteouſneſſe.—But becauſe that ſame righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Chriſt, ſo communicated to us by grace, ſo ſurely, that it may be ſurely ours, nor leſſe ſurely then our ſelves had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it, which we could not doe.</hi>

               <hi>Briefely, both are true, that Chriſts righteouſneſſe is the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent or meritorious cauſe of our righteouſneſſe.—And alſo either the formall cauſe, as</hi> Bellarmine, <hi>or the materiall, as we would rather, of our juſtification.</hi> See him againe.<note place="margin">

            <p>For both cauſes, both becauſe Chriſt is the efficient cauſe of righteouſnes inhering in us, and becauſe his ſatisfaction or merit is imputed unto us; we <hi>therefore thus determine Chriſt to be called our righteouſneſſe,</hi> and ſo as it followeth.</p>

               <hi>Onely I cannot but take notice of a very ſtrange peece of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity whereſoever he had it—Concerning</hi> Calvine, <hi>here he teacheth that ſinnes of commiſſion are taken away by that part of Chriſts ſatisfaction imputed, which is called his Paſſive obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or voluntary ſuffering the penalty of the Law: and ſinnes of commiſſion by his Active obedience in fulfilling the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which the Law requires, which is the other part of Chriſts imputed ſatisfaction.</hi> This you call <hi>a Lernean Lake, of hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and portentuous Divinity, things you ſhould have cenſured Mr.</hi> Walker <hi>would not have received, though an Angel from Heaven ſhould have brought them to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But—<hi>ſua narret Vlyſſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſumme is, there are ſinnes of commiſſion and of omiſſion, ſuch are all defects of what was to be in man, perfect righteouſneſſe. Though the guilt and puniſhment of all be taken away by the bloud of Chriſt a Lambe, the defect muſt alſo be made up by the perfect obedience of Chriſt our Surety, he muſt and did <hi>doe this that we may live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſay you, <hi>he affirmes the taking away of ſinnes of omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by the Active obedience of Chriſt onely, whereas the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth that without bloudſhedding there is no remiſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, <hi>onely</hi> is your owne, none of Mr. <hi>Walkers,</hi> and though it be given to the <hi>bloud</hi> of Chriſt as juſtification is, it is by a <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> as <hi>Calvine</hi> and others uſe to ſpeake; his Active righteouſneſſe is not excluded. It was the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious bloud of Chriſt as a Lambe without ſpot.</hi> Yea, his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings <hi>even to death</hi> were <hi>his obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Still you muſt remember that there be what is <hi>debitum in eſſe,</hi> to life, for which there is provided the active obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Chriſt; the Church is <hi>holy, unreprovable, unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, wholly faire, not by</hi> taking away <hi>ſpots alone,</hi> but the beauty of Chriſt put on it.</p>
            <p>You ſay <hi>he maketh the Active obedience of Chriſt penall and ſatisfactory, as if to live righteouſly and holy here had beene a puniſhment, when as himſelfe ſaith it was his meate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

               <hi>Sir,</hi> what if he had ſaid ſo? It was no leſſe to take mans <hi>nature</hi> to be made <hi>under the Law.</hi> It was the becomming <hi>poore</hi> of him that was <hi>rich,</hi> his <hi>humiliation</hi> and <hi>abaſement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yourſelfe ſay, <hi>it cannot be denied in all this, but that the Active obedience of Chriſt may in ſome ſenſe and reſpect be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſatisfactory too, as concurring and falling in with its influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence into the bloud or death of Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your reaſon, <hi>it was his meate, &amp;c.</hi> is a truth of Gods whole <hi>will in his hand.</hi> It was his meate to <hi>doe;</hi> I, and to <hi>ſuffer;</hi> he did it willingly, which yet you confeſſe <hi>was pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. You ſay, <hi>the worſt is, he divideth the ſatisfaction of Chriſt into parts, and utterly deſtroyeth and aboliſheth the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niteneſſe thereof: for what may be divided muſt needs be finite, and that which is the part of another cannot be infinite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I pray you, are they not diſtinguiſhable into Active and Paſſive? either they are, and differ, or are the ſame; and why doe you eſtabliſhing the one (if you doe ſo) diſpute againſt the other? is it not by both if they be inſeparable and not to be divided?</p>
            <p>Neither doth diviſion of Chriſt himſelfe, or doing and ſuffering aboliſh the infiniteneſſe of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> There are in him diſtinct two natures, three offices, body and ſoule, his Active obedience hath parts, and by parts were his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings made a whole. All which ſtand with Chriſts infinite nature, and the infinite value of his ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>And what doe you excluding Active obedience, which yet you confeſſe to be in a ſenſe ſatisfaction, and give all to what is Paſſive?</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> making our righteouſneſſe to conſiſt in the whole righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is farther from diviſion, leſſe deſtructive then your practiſe, denying and rejecting the Active obedience as the object of faith in juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your objections urged,</hi> p. 98. <hi>are trifling impertinencies,</hi> grieving your ſelfe, ſeparating them, not Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> who is for the whole obedience of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Amongſt them there is one paſſage to be taken notice
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:50493:85"/>
of as a gloſſe corrupting the text, the text is, <hi>If righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe be by the Law, Chriſt died in vaine,</hi> Gal. 2. 21. Your gloſſe, <hi>that it is true of the Law performed by Chriſt as well as by men themſelves, and then if the righteouſneſſe of the world be by the Active obedience of Chriſt his death muſt needs be in vaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is but a corruption of the text. The ſcope is, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification is not by mans perſonall obedience to the Law, and that if man had beene able to obey perfectly, the death of Chriſt had beene vaine; man not being able, but being a tranſgreſſor, Chriſts death is neceſſary, which doth not exclude his obedience to the Law for us, Chriſts death doth not (alone taken) make us juſt, as is required, and thus is it by our <hi>Surety</hi> ſupplied.</p>
            <p>Your ſelfe ſay <hi>it is ſatisfaction in a ſenſe, and to fall in with death,</hi> ſo farre righteouſneſſe is by the Law, Chriſts obedience unto the fame.</p>
            <p>You muſt acknowledge <hi>Chriſt a fulfiller of the Law,</hi> and and an <hi>eſtabliſher of it</hi> this way, and that <hi>faith in Chriſt doth not make the Law of God of none effect,</hi> as the word ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, and learned Expoſitors, of which before. And when as workes or the righteouſneſſe of the Law are excluded; it is not Chriſts, but a mans owne.</p>
            <p>Our Church in the Homily putteth Chriſts death as a ranſome, and yet add<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>, <hi>who beſides this ranſome fulfilled the Law for us perfectly. It requireth on Chriſts part juſtice, that is ſatisfaction to Gods juſtice, or the price of our redemption, by the offering of his body and ſhedding of his bloud, with fulfilling of the Law perfectly and throughly—So that in him our juſtification is not onely Gods mercy and grace, but alſo his juſtice, which the Apoſtle calleth the juſtice of God, and it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in paying our ranſome and fulfilling of the Law, and ſo the grace of God doth not ſhut out the juſtice of God in our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, but onely ſhutteth out the juſtice of man, that is to ſay, the juſtice of our workes, as to be merits or deſerving our juſtification: thus our Church in the Homily.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. I anſwer that <hi>Calvine</hi> and <hi>Luther</hi> take the word, faith, in this point of juſtification, as an inſtrument Relatively, figuratively, and that it juſtifieth as it taketh in its object Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe, and not in a proper ſenſe, as a worke conſidered in and by it ſelfe, and that they teach the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt to be that which being imputed by God, and applied by our faith, to be that whereby we be juſt before God, is as evident and cleare as the Sunne in the firmament ſhining at noone day.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the rankeſt enemies of Gods grace, whether <hi>Arminians</hi> or <hi>Papiſts;</hi> yet, never (knowing the ſame) were ſo inconſiderate to lay ſuch a charge on them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That it is an injurious kinde of dealing with Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, to force them to ſpeake againſt manifeſt expreſſures of themſelves in their writings, a miſerably poore ſhift, a ſigne that a man is neere driven in a ſtrait, deſperate, eſpecially in writing to doe ſo. It were more modeſty to ſay we underſtand them not, or deny their authority with reaſon, to ſay they erre, then thus as it were to ſnarle at them, and bite them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When as we ſpeake of faith that it is imperfect, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly, leprous, we ſpeake of it (though an inſtrument) as it is in it ſelfe, and therefore taking it ſo, deny it to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie as a worke, or for its worth, and ſay it hath need of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification it ſelfe; and that in juſtice God cannot account it for the righteouſneſſe of the Law, we ſpeake of it as of an hand that receiveth riches. Whether it be weake, or uncleane, or leprous, ſo it affordeth a ſtrong argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your proper ſenſe, and a neceſſity that when as it is ſaid to juſtifie that it ſhould doe ſo in reſpect to the object it is imployed about, the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt which it receiveth.</p>
            <p>And when as by a Trope the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is ſignified, or taken in with faith the inſtrument, there is
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:50493:88"/>
none that ſaith either that faith is the righteouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or whatſoever is predicated of the inſtrument faith, is true of the object of it the righteouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> When you prove theſe, <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall be and his righteouſnes as is ſaid of faith, imperfect, leprous, &amp;c. till then, though the faith that is imputed be ſo, it will not be true of the object, imperfection and leproſie is its owne. Juſtification properly is the effect of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, which is given to faith not as imperfect or weake, or ſtrong, but as an hand receiving the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, juſtifieth.</p>
            <p>Thus as I am able I have indeavoured to anſwer you, not leaving willingly as much as one paſſage unanſwered, and now may ſay, what you ſay not withſtanding or doe againſt Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> or the cauſe, <hi>He may ſtill have Peliade ſtomachum cedere neſcii.</hi> The ſtouter a man is for the truth, I ſay the truth, the greater is his glory.</p>
            <p>For a cloſe, give me leave to the many teſtimonies uſed already, to adde ſome more out of ſome learned moderne writers, by which the Reader may ſee whether the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſenſe of faith, or that which is Relative to its object the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt hath their conſtant patronage, and whether we be juſtified by faith in a proper ſenſe, or the imputation of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt.</p>

               <hi>That our juſtification and righteouſneſſe before God ſtandeth not in any inward vertues, &amp;c. but in the imputation of Chriſts obedience and righteouſneſſe made ours by faith, ſhall be proved</hi>

            <p>In that place, for this by the way he nameth, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 30.

               <hi>Now Mr.</hi> Perkins <hi>to take away the opinion of our owne righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and to ſhew that we have no other but the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt to reſt ſafely upon, alleadgeth as</hi> Gregory doth, <hi>the rigour and ſeverity of Gods judgement which admitteth of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is exact and perfect, according to the rule of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi>

            </p>
            <p>2. His ſecond argument is taken out of 2 <hi>Cor. 5. ult. As Chriſt was made ſinne for us, ſo we are made the righteouſneſſe of God in him. But Chriſt was made ſinne by the imputation of</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 399.</note> 
               <hi>our ſinnes being moſt boly. Therefore a ſinner is made righteous, in that Chriſts righteouſneſſe is imputed unto him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which are made good out of <hi>Anſelme, Auguſtine,</hi> and <hi>Hierome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where you ſhall finde a compariſon made good againſt you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And, that anſwered that he was made ſinne not by imputation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 401. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>but a Sacrifice. Where he demandeth why the Sacrifice of ſinne ſhould be called by the name of ſinne. See him who is large in ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thereunto,</hi> out of the Trope and Fathers. There I finde <hi>Chriſt needed not for himſelfe to be made under the Law, for to performe the righteouſneſſe thereof for his owne juſtification before God, being otherwiſe ſimply and abſolutely juſt. But what he did he did it for our ſakes, that we thereby through faith in</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 402. 403.</note> 
               <hi>him ſhould be juſtified in Gods ſight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It followeth that the righteouſneſſe of God muſt be underſtood of another righteouſneſſe, which is that whereof the Apoſtle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructeth</hi>
               <note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hitherto the Argument ſtandeth good. As Chriſt was made ſinne, ſo we are made righteouſneſſe; Chriſt was made ſinne by the imputation of our ſinne, we are therefore made righteous</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 404.</note> 
               <hi>by the imputation of his righteouſneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> his third Argument, is from <hi>Rom. 5. 19. As by the diſobedience of</hi> Adam, <hi>men were made ſinners, ſo
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:50493:96"/>
by the obedience of Chriſt are they made righteous. But men are made ſinners by the imputation of</hi> Adams <hi>ſinne unto them, and</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 404.</note> 
               <hi>not onely by propagation of naturall corruption: Therefore by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Chriſts juſtice we are made righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The caſe is very cleare, that if we be ſinners by the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of</hi> Adams <hi>ſinne, then are we alſo righteous by the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 405.</note> 
               <hi>of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where he defendeth the imputation af <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, which he proveth againſt <hi>Biſhop,</hi> (and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe ſomewhere, and you) <hi>out of</hi> Bellarmine <hi>citing</hi> Bernard for it, &amp;c. and <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> p. 406. and <hi>Bernard,</hi> p. 407. and <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But that is not all, but likewiſe he accounteth faith to him for righteouſneſſe, becauſe faith doth ſanctifie and make a man righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, &amp;c.</hi> And then cry out <hi>evidence.</hi>

                  <p>6. Againe, It ſeemeth much to me that you ſhould hold an abſolute excluſion of the works of the Law when as you eſtabliſh Faith in a proper ſenſe, and as a worke of obedience, as righteouſneſſe, if it be required in the Law (which conſidered againſt your deniall, the learned hold) the Law is not to be abſolutely excluded. And though it be not in the Law originally; yet you know, <hi>It may be ſuperadded, and in the Law as now it ſtandes with additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and improvements:</hi> Which is your owne diſtinction, Treat. 2. p. 47. and 48. I may apply it to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                  <p>7.

If there be a truth in your 2. Concluſion, your abſolute excluſion will not ſtand.</p>
                  <p>8. Then if <hi>Remiſſion of ſin</hi> (the forme of Juſtification as you) <hi>includes the imputation or acknowledgement of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the whole Law, as the imputation of the Law ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled includes not imputation of ſin, that ſuch an one is looked upon is one that hath fullfilled the Law. If in the act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, there be included the imputation of a perfect righteouſneſſe, which is all one with a perfect fulfilling of the

                  <p>9. I will but name it. Others (you know) are againſt you and teach a neceſſity of obedience to the Law to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, as our debt, and that eternall way of God to live.</p>
                  <p>And that theſe places intend not obedience to the Law ſimply, but performed by our owne perſons, though this is not perſonall performance, and that ſuch obedience is impoſſible, it followeth not of the Law, performed for us by our Mediator. So our Church, &amp;c. See before, and ſome of the reaſons now named are confeſſedly, inforce; as, where the death of Chriſt, is ſatisfaction to the Law.</p>
                  <p>But you cannot indure this anſwer; and therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, ſay, 1. <hi>Not to be juſtified by the workes of the Law, is as much as not to be juſtified by any workes of the Law whatſoever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, True, performed by a mans ſelfe, not by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and whether what hath beene premiſed, be not ſufficient againſt an abſolute excluſion of the Law, which is in your argument, and that <hi>ex conceſſis,</hi> I leave to your ſecond thoughts.</p>
                  <p>2. Neither is there <hi>blame in the Apoſtle, or unfaithfullneſſe:</hi> Seeing, where he layeth downe that we are made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by the obedience of Chriſt, he layeth downe the workes of obedience of Chriſt to the Law. Not to uſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions elſe premiſed, that neceſſary influence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of it with the paſſive obedience.</p>
                  <p>3. Neither is it therefore <hi>a ſnare upon men,</hi> ſeeing there is intimation ſufficient, and incluſion of his obedience to the Law, ſo manifeſt as hath beene ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>4. Neither had Saint <hi>Paul need your teaching him to preach,</hi> he Preached Chriſt our Mediatour and Surety, humbled to death for us, <hi>Obedient to death for us.</hi> And juſtification by Faith in him. All which notwithſtanding, they <hi>were ignorant of that</hi> which is called Gods righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and hence they eſtabliſhed their <hi>owne Righteouſneſſe,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50493:101"/>
and ſubmitted not themſelves to the righteouſneſſe of God, which is Chriſt, the end of the Law for righteouſneſſe to beleevers.</hi> When as there is ſuch an evident, abſolute, neceſſary concurrence and incluſions and interpretations as have beene ſpoken of, you may ſee the vanity of this illuſion.</p>
                  <p>Here you urge objected againſt your ſelfe, that <hi>Paul</hi> gave ſufficient intimation of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, when as he firſt excludeth what is done by our ſelves, and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth Chriſts doing the workes of the Law.

                  <p>When as it is ſaid not by works of Righteouſnes which we have done, it's all-one as to ſay our owne ſelves have

                     <hi>Gods mercy.</hi> For as Gods mercy and Chriſts death ſtand together and have place in Juſtification, ſo Chriſts workes concurring with Chriſts death, the mercy of God and Chriſts merits agree ſweetly.</p>

                  <p>Yea ſaving implyeth as freedome from guilt and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo righteouſneſſe by which, though it be not here expreſſed. Finally, paſſing that non-ſenſe, given as a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why this place is impertinent, in theſe words: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is evident that the Apoſtle here rejects the workes of Righteouſneſſe, which he names from being any cauſes anteceda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly moving God to ſave us, and not from being the forme of Juſtification.</hi> For it maketh the Apoſtle not to exclude workes of Righteouſneſſe from being the forme of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and ſo to be a Patron of Popery, whoſe tenet that is.

                  </p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer, not Chriſts workes, but Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in Chriſt, and by his active and paſſive obedience. Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy moved God <hi>to chuſe us in Chriſt, to appoint us to ſalvation by the meanes of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and accordingly to execute the ſame in whole ſalvation, in Juſtification; though it moveth as being the meritorious cauſe, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the matter, as after, and forme as applyed in waſhing us by the Holy Ghoſt, the Spirit applying or ſprinkling
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50493:102"/>
us with the blood of that holy Lambe, waſheth, ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and juſtifieth.</p>
                  <p>The ſame blood of that holy Lambe, or active and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive obedience of Chriſt that juſtifieth, is not onely a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious cauſe, and ſo ſit matter (which could not be, if it had not worth) but alſo that which applyed ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth the place of a forme juſtifying, which were it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo worthy, without application it could never doe. When you lay downe Reaſons you ſhall heare more.</p>
                  <p>To that place, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. that you may illude it, you ſay,<note place="margin">P. 66.</note> Firſt, <hi>Chriſts being made under the Law, doth not ſignifie Chriſts ſubjection to the Morall Law, but rather the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall Law; that was it we were under, from that he redeemed us, and it is not reaſonable he made under any other Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, We were under the Morall Law, its curſe and condemnation, under its ſtrict and perſonall perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, as well as it, conſidered as a rule of life. And though it continueth as a rule of life, we are by Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from the curſe and condemnation thereof, and ſtrict perſonall performance of it. And this was the effect and end of Chriſts making under the Law. And there is more reaſon that this ſhould be infolded, for as much as this was the greateſt bondage of the twaine.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Youſay, <hi>Taking it for the Morall Law, it was</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>1. It was to the preceptive part as well as the curſe. Both are our debt, our Surety was accurſed for us, and fullfilled all Righteouſneſſe for us; paid our whole debt.</p>
                  <p>2. When as you ſay his death was the price, by which he deſerved our Juſtification. You will have us, and wee you, to remember, It was not ſo without <hi>influence of the active obedience of Chriſt.</hi> You will not have <hi>the active obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience

                  <p>And Sir, it is the common tenet of Proteſtants, that the obedience of Chriſt is the matter of juſtification, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, the forme, that is ſuch by analogy, and inſtead thereof.

                     <hi>THe Scriptures doe abſolutely deny a transferribleneſſe, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation or transferring, or moving the righteouſneſſe of one perſon to another, from</hi> Gal. 3. 12. <hi>and the Law is not of faith, but the man that doth them ſhall live in them, it denieth it to be done with faith, which was the likelieſt hand under Heaven—by which he intendeth to make the righteouſnes of the Law as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Chriſt uncapable of this tranſlation or imputation—faith derives remiſſion from Chriſt, but not the righteouſnes of the Law, the ſcope ſheweth it is the very doer that ſhall live, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Removing righteouſnes from one perſon to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are not our words, we ſay not that Chriſts righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes imputed is removed, or that it is taken from Chriſt,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50493:110"/>
we teach it to be ſubjective in him ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>We aſſert his righteouſneſſe transferrible, that is, that it may be, and is imputed or given to us.</p>
                  <p>He was our <hi>Surety,</hi> he ſatisfied for us, if there be an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute impoſſibility of transferring what is done for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you deſtroy ſuretiſhip, Chriſts being our <hi>Surety.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. His death is imputable, or ſufferings of death, you muſt hold that imputation of them, or elſe confeſſe your ſelfe a <hi>Socinian,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gat.</hi> exempteth himſelfe thereby, dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with <hi>Lucius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If his ſufferings, all of them, from his incarnation or conception to his death, his being man, doings and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, forme of a ſervant, ſervices in that forme, all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, unto, till death, as well as death it ſelfe; in which there are many ſervile acts to the Law. Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not them or their imputation, nor <hi>Pareus;</hi> your ſelfe teach a concurrence and influence of works abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to make atonement.</p>
                  <p>And if Chriſt did not obey for himſelfe (which was vaine, ſeeing he lived from the firſt moment) it was for us; his being man holy and juſt, &amp;c. was his humiliation, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, <hi>he became poore, that we through his poverty might be made rich.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His ſufferings were fulfillings of the Law, <hi>even puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Etiam paena eſt impletio Legis <hi>Par. de Juſt. Act. &amp;c. p.</hi> 183.</note> 
                     <hi>is the fulfilling of the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If ſufferings are imputable, the fulfilling of the Law is in all theſe reſpects, and are imputed, or elſe we have no good by them. It is nothing that there is ſuch vertue in Jeſus Chriſt if there be no application, and application receiving on our part neceſſarily putteth giving and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Now to your argument, we deny the Law to be that by which we are juſtified, or that the righteouſneſſe by which is Legall. It is evident (ſay we) becauſe that run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, <hi>The man that doth this ſhall live;</hi> if we were ſo legally, we muſt be ſo in &amp; by our ſelves perſonally, <hi>doe this</hi> neither needed we a Mediator; we cannot doe this, this and faith are <hi>aſyſtata,</hi> put this, faith is vaine in this matter, when
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50493:111"/>
we diſclaime perſonall <hi>doe this,</hi> there muſt be grace, and that in Chriſt. He muſt be a Surety, conceived, borne, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, even to death, dead to make ſatisfaction; Gods giving him to us, our receiving of him, beleeving in him, by which we have union and communion with him, and his obedience, Paſſive, and what neceſſarily concurreth and in-floweth thereunto. In Chriſt we have pardon, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, and eternall life; imputation of righteouſneſſe is neceſſary to pardon; by imputation of righteouſnes we are made juſt, and ſo juſtified from ſinnes; by adoption we are heires of the righteouſnes of faith, that is, the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes which faith apprehendeth; <hi>we inherit the promiſes,</hi> that of righteouſnes by which we are white as Snow, whiter.</p>
                  <p>And this righteouſnes is neceſſary to life, <hi>the Spirit is life becauſe of righteouſneſſe,</hi> imputed, <hi>Chamieer, Rom. 8. 10. they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, ſhall reigne in life even by one Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 5. 16. <hi>Grace reignes through righteouſneſſe to eternall life,</hi> verſ. <hi>ult.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is <hi>Gods righteouſnes;</hi> what he giveth, and we by faith receive; there is a ſubordination betweene Gods grace, the promiſe, Chriſt, his obedience, pardon, life, faith, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes is not perſonall but of the Surety. And this is notably ſet forth as by forraine Divines, ſo by our owne, and the Doctrine of our Church, to which we have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. I will ſend you thither, and proceed.</p>

                  <p>He that is arraied in this, and preſents himſelfe before God, is ſo ſay you. <hi>Not in the habit of a juſt or righteous man, but in the glorious attire that makes men juſt and righteous, the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50493:112"/>
great Mediator of the world, whoſe righteouſneſſe hath heights and depths in it, a length and breadth which infinitely excecded the dimenſions and proportions of all men whatſoever.—The glory of this righteouſneſſe doth tranſcend the condition of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.—All the parts of this righteouſneſſe, all the acts of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience that he performed, he performed them as one that had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the ſpirit without meaſure; there was a righteouſneſſe and worth in them which did fully anſwer the fulneſſe of that grace that was given him above all his fellowes, &amp;c.</hi> p. 108. 109. 10.</p>
                  <p>You object to your ſelfe, <hi>love is the fulfilling of the Law, Chriſts perfect love, is perfect fulfilling the Law; and therefore being imputed may ſerve, though ſome acts of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience wanting.</hi> To this purpoſe you object; but Sir, we ſay not that there is any thing wanting.</p>
                  <p>1. You anſwer, <hi>love may be an Evangelicall fulfilling the Law and accepted, yet holds not out weight and meaſure for any mans juſtification in the covenant of workes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to no purpoſe, that objection urgeth not our love but Chriſts, and not therefore juſtification by a covenant of workes, but of grace by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And it will not follow that if his love be imputed, other acts of righteouſneſſe were vaine, for what you call other, are no other then love, ſo all are acts of righteouſnes</p>
                  <p>2. I anſwer to the ſecond, that the love of Chriſt is the fulfilling of the whole Law (both Tables.)</p>
                  <p>3. I anſwer thirdly, that love (as you grant) being a cauſe of the being of the reſt, and having (what you call) the reſt vertually in it, <hi>a ſpirituall unfeigned affection of love is an inward principle of that nature which inclineth and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a man to the performance and practice of all manner of duties required in the Law.</hi> Grant Chriſts love this: It will not <hi>be ridiculous to ſay his love is imputed for their righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>

                        </gap>tale illud eſt magis tale.</note> For being a cauſe and vertually including fulfilling, it will ſerve. It is more to be a cauſe then to fulfill the Law, and love conſiſteth not onely in affection but acts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they are love in words and deeds.</p>
                  <p>And there is ſomewhat in it when as <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſeth
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50493:113"/>
his <hi>life to be by faith in the Son of God who hath loved me and given himſelfe for me,</hi> in which there are both his active and paſſive obedience, 2 <hi>Gal.</hi> 20. and the objects of his faith.</p>
                  <p>2. You object, <hi>It is ſufficient though there be what is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to ſuch particular acts of righteouſneſſe,</hi> and anſwer.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>The Law muſt have jot for jot, tittle for tittle, point for point, letter for letter, otherwiſe it hath a curſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. I anſwer, not queſtioning but Chriſt yeelded jot for jot, tittle, &amp;c. <hi>He infinitely exceeded the dimenſions and proportions of all men whatſoever,</hi> as you: where is more, there are jots and tittles.</p>
                  <p>But Sir, How ſhall your faith not taking in this righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of Chriſt, nay oppoſed, be jot for jot, &amp;c. and how will <hi>Gods judgement be according to truth,</hi> if that be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteed of <hi>doe this?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. And ſecondly, I anſwer to the ſecond, that the acts of Chriſt imputed are the acts of him that was our <hi>Surety,</hi> which infinitely exceeding the dimenſions and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all men whatſoever, ſerve the neceſſities of all men whatſoever; every mans turne is ſerved here, even that which the Lord requireth of him; to omit that thoſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences are taken away.</p>
                  <p>3. You object to your ſelfe <hi>equivalence in his doings as in his ſufferings, the debt was eternall death, he paid it by what was not eternall, but equivalent, and ſo might by doing.</hi> And anſwer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Denying thoſe words Thou ſhalt die the death, muſt of neceſſity meane eternall death, according to the letter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Neither that nor by way of equivalencie, was not Gods meaning, but the evill of puniſhment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> repreſented and knowne to him by the name of death, without conſideration of duration.</hi> I anſwer.</p>
                  <p>1. Sir, to <hi>die the death</hi> is ſuch a puniſhment, which though it hath not eternity of its nature, yet it hath eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity a concomitant as your ſelfe out of <hi>Scotus,</hi> and that is<note place="margin">In fe.</note> in it ſelfe (becauſe of concomitancy) for ever, the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from it is accidentall. It is eternall in the threat, as is ſeene in execution on Devils and wicked men, it had beene ſo to us if our <hi>Surety</hi> had not borne it, and beene on
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50493:113"/>
him for ever had he not overcome it.</p>
                  <p>3. But then you anſwer, 3. that though <hi>God did take liberty to vary from the curſe, and to uſe equivalency, it followeth not God ſhould accept ſuch legall payment as is equivalent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer (ſtill premiſing that Chriſt yeelded compleat ſatisfaction as before) that if God did vary in the curſe, he received legall payment which is equivalent, death was le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall payment, and doing you object is but legall payment; <hi>The ſoule that ſinneth ſhall die,</hi> is the voice of the Law.</p>
                  <p>To that you farther adde of God that <hi>having received a full ſatisfaction of all the tranſgreſſions of the Law he may by a ſecond covenant accept of what he pleaſeth to inſtate men in this benefit, which is to him evivalent to perfect legall righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>

                  <p>I anſwer, that which Chriſt paid being the full ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the Law, anſwereth our debt compleatly, and there is no need of any thing elſe to be accepted, (It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious indeed) that is equivalent to compleat legall righteouſneſſe, that ſatisfaction of righteouſneſſe onely graciouſly imputed to us as performed by our Surety for us, is enough. Faith indeed hath the place of an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or hand receiving what is accounted or given, by which applied I am juſt, and ſo have priviledges; but hath no equivalence to the righteouſneſſe of the Law, as in it ſelfe, in juſtification, excluding the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt as you hold it out; and the ſatisfaction of the Law by Chriſt our Surety, to ſuch a faith is what God doth by the covenant of grace.—</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>1. I anſwer, imputation of righteouſneſſe, righteous making, giveth a title to life or Heaven; if regeneration doth ſo which is but imperfect (wherein yet adoption is founded) perfect righteouſneſſe given and received much more, which is of the twaine, the chiefeſt foundation of adoption: <hi>the Spirit is life becauſe of righteouſneſſe,</hi> Rom. 8. 10. which learned <hi>Chamieer</hi> interpreteth of imputed righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, <hi>thoſe that receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteouſneſſe, ſhall raigne in life,</hi> Rom. 5. 17. <hi>By the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of one the free gift came upon all to juſtification of life,</hi> verſ. 18. <hi>Grace raignes through righteouſneſſe to eternall life,</hi> verſ. <hi>ult.</hi>

                  <p>3. We ſay not we have no right by pardon, and it is

not true, ſeeing I finde that concurring as the conſequent of righteouſneſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. the places you cited; eſpecially if <hi>he that is freed from ſinne is</hi> ipſo facto <hi>made perfectly and compleatly righteous,</hi> as you concluſ. <hi>part. 2. p. 4.

                  </p>
                  <p>We deny it not to adoption, when as we give it to righteouſneſſe imputed, we exclude not Gods gracious dignifying, no we give a place to every grace, faith, hope, love; which have the promiſes of Salvation. We conceive adoption will not in its claime exclude the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt imputed, which is the maine thing: we be heires of the promiſes, all, of righteouſneſſe lapt up in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe thereof.</p>
                  <p>Noah <hi>was an heire of the righteouſneſſe, which is by faith, Heb.</hi> 11. 7. that is, the righteouſneſſe which faith apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and that is that which God imputeth or giveth, Chriſts, ſo that adoption doth not exclude it.</p>
                  <p>Yea, we read <hi>that the promiſe was not made to</hi> Abraham <hi>that he ſhould be the heire of the world, or to his ſeede through the Law, but through the righteouſneſſe of faith,</hi> Rom. 4. 13. in which the promiſe of heire-ſhip is made to him by that, as it were antecedent. I will not contend againſt adoptions title, and you muſt beware you contend not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the title which is by the righteouſneſſe of faith, and beware of your concluſion of its being proper to adoption or conſequences againſt ſuch pregnant Scriptures. Indeed ſalvation is by faith in Chriſt, hence adoption, participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of righteouſneſſe to juſtification, to ſalvation. You cannot exclude the death of Chriſt from being a cauſe of our ſalvation, nor reaſonably leave out the active obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Chriſt, its eſſentiall requiſite; neither is of force to that end, but as given and received, which is imputation to the beleever.</p>
                  <p>And hereby you may perceive your errour, 1. in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:50493:117"/>
theſe of divers and contrary natures.</p>
                  <p>2. In that you make the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, which is anothers, our Sureties, graciouſly performed for us, and given unto us, Evangelicall, to be Legall.</p>
                  <p>3. Conſider whether you be not too wiſe in arguing the vanity of the one from ſufficiencie of the other, when as God hath joyned them together, when as they are ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to, that effect: adoption is founded in regeneration that new birth which qualifieth to juſtification, but much more in imputed righteouſneſſe, which alone is perfect righteouſneſſe; which juſtification qualifieth to life, <hi>whom be juſtified be glorified.</hi>

                  <p>All the diſtinct graces in which adoption is founded, make up a plurality of meanes qualifying to juſtification, to pardon and life. It is very falſe that nature hath not a concurrence of many cauſes to effects, the ſunne and man, male, female, not to exclude God who is the firſt. It is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry falſe that God in the Goſpel ſtill allowes but one meane<note place="margin">And ſee <hi>P.</hi> 143. the text cited, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11. 6.</note> for one purpoſe, the Word, Sacraments, Prayer, Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and Saints, &amp;c. are all ordained to the ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our faith, and to our ſalvation. Neither doth the Lord complaine of plurality of meanes, but of ſuch as are none of his, or contrary, ſuch is legall righteouſneſſe, perſonall obedience: ſo the places, <hi>Rom. 4. 14.

See that you be not one that laugh theſe to ſcorne.</p>
                  <p>And ſee whether your faith in a proper ſenſe be not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your owne laſh, oppoſed profeſſedly to the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt; from the poſition of one ſubordinate to the negation of another eſtabliſhed by God, is a vaine and frivolous argumentation.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>I deny what is aſſumed, a Chriſtian compleate in Chriſt, white as Snow, whiter, yet needeth repentance, hath it to qualify him to the promiſe of righteouſneſſe, juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, remiſſion: as it ſuppoſeth faith, which alone juſtifieth, ſo repentance qualifying faith, and conditioning the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that faith that juſtifieth is not alone, thoſe that are <hi>ſanctified are perfected for ever,</hi> the ſame <hi>Spirit ſanctifieth and juſtifieth</hi> at the ſame time.</p>
                  <p>If it ſtood in an univerſall non-imputation of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe or pardon, is not ſuch a man perfectly righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as your ſelves teach; are they not <hi>contraria immediata,</hi> as your ſelves urge? yet you teach need of repentance daily, as qualifying the ſubject to the promiſe; there is the ſame reaſon: here pardon ſuppoſeth in deed imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of righteouſneſſe by which our ſinnes are not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, therefore it is that they ſtand not guilty of any ſinne before God.</p>
                  <p>Yea, we aſſert they have the rights and priviledges ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying ſuch a righteouſneſſe not in poſſeſſion, but in Chriſt their head, in the promiſe which abideth for ever, by faith and hope, as the man, perfect by non-imputation of unrighteouſneſſe; (he hath right to life, <hi>he hath everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life, John</hi> 3. 36. and yet that conſiſtent with ſinne, where there is <hi>no condemnation,</hi> nay, <hi>everlaſting life, there is a lawleſſe Law, &amp;c.</hi> Yea there is an imperfect faith which is not without ſinne.</p>
                  <p>When as <hi>p.</hi> 148. you tell us of the intrinſecal and formal property of a worke of the Law, that it hath power to juſtifie out of internall worth and dignity. You agree not with truth, which teacheth that when <hi>a man hath done all, he muſt ſay, he is an unprofitable ſervant, doing but what he
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50493:118"/>
ought,</hi> nor with your ſelfe, <hi>p. 191. He hath done what was duty to doe: and this by our Saviours rule,</hi> Luc. 17. 10. <hi>makes but an unprofitable ſervant,</hi> i. <hi>(I conceive) It is no ground to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or challenge any great matters at his Maſters band, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be by covenant or promiſe from him:</hi> theſe are your words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It taketh away the neceſity of his death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It doth not, but eſtabliſh it, by both theſe imputed a beleever is juſtified, indeed had he Beene ſo before this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, or not by it and with it, ſomewhat might be ſaid, now nothing againſt it, the righteouſnes of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 21. is perſonall, <hi>the man that doth it ſhall live,</hi> Chriſts imputed, is not legall.</p>
                  <p>And what you talk of imputableneſſe of Chriſts active obedience, without his deaths is ignorance, that his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience was to beginne with life, and to end in death; and you forget now your former doctrine of concurrence of active and paſſive obedience, and abſolute neceſſity of both to make atonement, and that both make up but one obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>When you argue againſt the imputableneſſe of this righteouſneſſe of Chriſt by a queſtion; <hi>Why ſhould not men be capable of imputation thereof in the middeſt of their ſins, as well as Chriſt was capable of imputation of their ſinnes, in the middeſt of his righteouſneſſe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Firſt, it is impertineut to our queſtion. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the reaſon is, the inconſiſtencie of juſtification and wickedneſſe. Thirdly, <hi>abomination to the Lord,</hi> and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God requireth a lively faith to participation of the ſame, receiving it, and making it ours, the promiſe is made unto a beleever repenting. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 1. 16.</p>

way thinke to diſtinguiſh themſelves ſafe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The major is Doctor <hi>Prideaux's,</hi> as before, and the aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption is falſe from the poſition of a cauſe, to the denyall of the effect, as the learned; as Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> alſo, though in ſomewhat not agreeing with them, acknowledgeth forgiveneſſe of ſinnes to be ſo, or a conſequent.</p>
                  <p>And in truth when as God imputeth Chriſts righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and pardoneth them, they have no more ſinne then Chriſt to be pardoned; all are pardoned, theſe are <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria immediata,</hi> and you know there is no third or middle: though not in the ſame manner Chriſt was, yet <hi>quoad veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem,</hi> and thus for this argument.</p>
                  <p>The exception and anſwer you make of remitting firſt, and then imputing, is a fancie of your owne to be negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. Both are together for time, the order is imputation of righteouſneſſe, just making, then remiſſion of ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>You object by way of addition, <hi>that Chriſt hath taught us to pray for remiſſion after this imputation, unleſſe it be taught infidels onely, but to aske forgiveneſſe and conceive our ſelves as righteous as Chriſt, is rather to make God, then worſhip him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, that petition for pardon after juſtification is Chriſts ordinance, whether juſtification conſiſteth in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of righteouſneſſe or pardon, it mattereth not to that, all muſt doe it.</p>
                  <p>2. That by juſtification (whether it conſiſt in one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) it is confeſt that perſon is perfectly righteous.</p>
                  <p>3. That he that doth ſo doth not mocke God, ſeeing it is obedience to that commandement, ſeeing it is Gods way whereby pardon is ſued out to the quiet of a mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
                  <p>4. That the ſame is as much againſt your ſelfe, who make it to ſtand in remiſſion of ſins, unleſſe you think your ſelfe not thereby perfectly righteous, or being ſo, not bound to uſe that prayer; anſwer your ſelfe, and you ſhall ſave us a labour.</p>
                  <p>5. Finally, what you object againſt us, holdeth againſt imputation of faith in your ſenſe, for let faith be righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe or not; if it be by Gods acceptation, as <hi>doe and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50493:119"/>
live</hi> to juſtification, and I am by it intereſted in all the priviledges of a juſt man. Why may not I be ſaid to mock God (when as I conceive my ſelfe as perfectly righteous in Gods account) in asking pardon, as in being ſo indeed? I doe but ſuppoſe: there is as full a juſtification, as perfect a deliverance from death and condemnation, as in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer caſe, as yourſelfe grant.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, the queſtion is not of being of ſin or of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of ſanctification, this is denied on both ſides, and ſinnes being is graunted, though not imputed, and ſo though righteouſneſſe be imputed, and thence no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Neither is the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt imputed a legall righteouſneſſe as hath beene ſhewed, that is, perſonall <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this,</hi> being it another thing is conſiſtent with ſinne <hi>ex conceſſis.</hi>

                  <p>SUch is the leader, <hi>i. That it is true that many that hold the way of imputation are not aſhamed, nor afraid to confound the two Covenants of God, of Workes and Grace. That God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made more Covenants then one; that the Goſpel is nothing elſe but a gracious aide or reliefe from God to helpe man out with the performance of the Covenant of workes: ſo that that life and ſalvation which is ſaid to come by Chriſt, ſhall in no other ſenſe be ſaid to come by him, but onely as he fulfilled the Law of works for man; and ſuch is that of their inheriting life and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion according to the ſtrict and rigid tenour of the Law,</hi> Doe this.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are your demonſtrations foundation, the reſt are ſuperſtructures; to anſwer them were to fight with a ſhadow: this I anſwer without demurring. I profeſſe I never read man that did hold thoſe tenets as laid downe by you.</p>
                  <p>We give to Gods grace in Chriſt the whole ſalvation of beleevers, beginning, conſummation, adoption, juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, pardon, ſanctification, mortification, graces, exerciſe, growth, perfection, the ſaving of the ſoule and glorious reſurrection.</p>
                  <p>We give all to free grace, we ſay it is founded in another, a Surety, Jeſus Chriſt ſatisfying Gods juſtice in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe. We teach the death of Chriſt, nay, the neceſſity of his incarnation, his taking our nature, doing and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the forme of a ſervant, obeying to death; the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of his reſurrection, aſcenſion, and ſitting at Gods right hand.</p>

The performance of the Surety for me is accepted as if my ſelfe had done it.</p>
                  <p>Againſt this you argue, <hi>then is Chriſt in his ſufferings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to have ſinned in me, an aſſertion uncouth and un-Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer, my ſinnes were his by imputation, they were laid on him my Surety, and in that ſenſe he was a ſinner, as well as a Sacrifice for ſinne.

                  <p>Of which when as I am ſaid to be juſtified or acquitted, I muſt needs be a partaker, it muſt be mine that I may be acquitted; neither doth the Scripture deny it, when as it ſaith a Chriſtian is dead to ſinne.

                  <p>You now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> come to the imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, to his poſterity, aſſenring its imputation onely in the merit of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it, it is a curſe or puniſhment, and then propoſe to us certaine concluſions about the ſame.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, <hi>The Scripture no where affirmes either the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of</hi> Adams <hi>ſinne, or of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt to thoſe that beleeve; where ever it is uſed, it is onely applied to ſomething of the ſame perſons to whom the imputation is made, and never to or of any thing of anothers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides what hath beene ſpoken, to which I referre the Reader.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This concluſion is againſt imputation ſimply of what is anothers, and is for <hi>Armin. Socin. &amp;c.</hi> againſt all Proteſtants, even ſuch as hold the imputation of Chriſts paſſive obedience, which is anothers.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is againſt the word which ſpeaketh of imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of righteouſneſſe, <hi>Rom. 4. verſ. 6. &amp;</hi> 11. which I have ſhewed to be Chriſts, and is confuted by the Proteſtant ſtreame, who interpreting faiths imputation, take faith tropically and include the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt given or imputed by God. <hi>Pareus</hi> his ſpeech is, <hi>quem ſenſum (metonymicum) ſi oppugnat adverſarius, certe non</hi> Lutheruum <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnat ſed Spiritum ſanctum blaſphemat, &amp;c.</hi> and what <hi>Sybr.</hi> teacheth of the ſame we have heard before.</p>

not onely performed, but given and received, as the effect the cauſe.</p>
                  <p>So doth our death for <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, and that ſinne is ours, the Scripture ſheweth we <hi>ſinned in him,</hi> and that <hi>ſinne went over all by one mans diſobedience;</hi> we not onely die, <hi>but ſinne, death paſſed over all, being all have ſinned,</hi> Rom. 5. 12. <hi>and by one mans offence many are made ſinners,</hi> verſ. 19.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity are implied to be in his loynes to puniſhment, ſo to ſinne whence puniſhment, and this your ſelfe often confeſſe, which by imputation becometh ours, when as we are conceived.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To impute ſinne, is onely to charge guilt of ſinne on a man,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>with a purpoſe to puniſh him for it, as</hi> Rom. 5. 13. <hi>not ſinne it ſelfe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, the Scripture chargeth us with both <hi>Adams</hi> ſin and the demerit or guilt thereof, &amp; I would know whether ſinne and guilt demerit are ſeparable? if not, how there can be guilt charged, and demerit, and not ſinne, as the ſinne is, the demerit is, inſeparably, though not the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of it.</p>
                  <p>Hath many parts, the firſt is, <hi>That imputation of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe</hi>
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>of Chriſt to beleevers, or the ſinne of</hi> Adam <hi>to his poſterity, are expreſſions at leaſt unknowne to the holy Ghoſt in Scripture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. The anſwer is, this was once before named and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, and muſt be now neglected. <hi>Hoſius</hi> the Papiſt ſaid it of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, you are like him.</p>
                  <p>2. You ſay, <hi>you grant there are expreſſions in Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning both the communication of</hi> Adams <hi>ſinne with his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt with beleevers, that will fairely enough beare the terme of imputation, if it be rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So the termes are granted, the difficulty is about the right ſenſe; thus you deſtroy what you built before twice in this chapter. Now for the ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>You ſay, <hi>Rom. 5. 19. concerning</hi> Adams <hi>ſinne, many are ſaid to be ſinners, and righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, many are made righteous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and upon that if the meaning of imputation of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50493:129"/>
                     <hi>ſinne to condemnation be that the demerit or guilt of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams <hi>ſinne is charged on the whole poſterity, a maine part of which puniſhment of</hi> Adams ſinne <hi>redounded and ranne over as it were from his perſon to his whole poſterity, a maine part of which puniſhment is that originall defilement wherein they are all conceived and borne, and thereby are made truly and formally ſinners before God. Let it paſſe. But if the meaning be that ſinfull act wherein</hi> Adam <hi>tronſgreſſed in the letter and formality of it; and as it was</hi> Adams <hi>owne perſonall ſinne is ſo imputed that his poſterity is made formally ſinners before any of the part of the puniſhment come upon them, this impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation you are ſure the Scripture will not juſtifie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, granting the former part, for guilt and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, that by which we are formally ſinners, that is inherently. But adde that is not all, the act of <hi>Adam</hi> as well as the demerit, nay therefore becauſe the demerit is imputed, and by it as I am formally a ſinner by polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of nature, which is an effect, ſo am I truly a ſinner, thence denominated, not formally as it inhering, and yet charged on me, with, and as the internall guilt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit. So that I am as truly a ſinner by imputation of that act, as the effect thereof, ſo the texts of which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You plead firſt <hi>the weight of the demerit, or ſinfulneſſe of it demonſtrateth the equity of Gods proceedings in binding over</hi> Adams <hi>poſterity, as his perſon to the ſame puniſhment.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>All theſe as grounds of Gods equity and juſt dealing in puniſhing</hi> Adam <hi>and his poſlerity, you largely lay downe, and then by Scripture.</hi>

and reaſon that the internal demerit and ſinne are inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, you call it demerit or ſinfulneſſe.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>If it be our owne, then not the puniſhment onely but the offence is ours, we are ſinners thence as well as from inward pollution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as it is equall as ſoone as we exiſt that the puniſhment ſhould be laid on us, and the demerit, ſo the ſinne it ſelfe, as that for which, which we all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be by Gods imputation or charging it on us.</p>
                  <p>God righteouſly puniſheth and righteouſly reputeth me a ſinner. And yet it is <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, the ſinne of one in Scripture; he onely exiſting, made ours by Gods juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in conception and birth, and that by imputation, which we conceive Gods way of communication which you granted but now, for which there is ſuch equity as you ſpeake of; for more to this head I referre you to what is before largely ſpoken unto twice to this head, of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox againſt Pelagians and Papiſts, and on occaſion gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in what followeth.</p>

                  <p>We anſwere, we have done it and find imputation of the righteouſnes of Chriſt (as interpreters before) and ſo pardon or non imputation; <hi>by the obedience of one we are conſtituted righteous.</hi> Theſe we find not your interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                  <p>To which you adde, <hi>the reaſon may be happily, this life,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which comes by Chriſt through Faith, are of an higher na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then that promiſed</hi> Adam, <hi>as wages for worke, or obedience to the Law, requiring a fuller and richer title, to intereſt the creature then that. Worke performed intituleth ſufficiently to hire and wages: but the gift of an inheritance requireth grace and ſpeciall favour as adoption, to make a man regularly and according to the courſe of humane tranſaction capable therof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. I anſwer. Life by Chriſt is eternall. 2. Eternall life was promiſed to thoſe that <hi>doe this:</hi> as that queſtion <hi>what ſhall I doe to inherit eternall life?</hi> and the anſwer of Chriſt ſheweth in the Goſpel. 3. This was of an higher nature then that life which <hi>Adam</hi> had and injoyed, but not then was promiſed.

                  <p>4. We have by Chriſt a richer title, Chriſt his merits, his active and pasſive obedience, doings, ſufferings im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted; <hi>by his poverty we are made rich, by his obedience we

are conſtituted righteous;</hi> theſe performed by our ſurety accounted to us intitle us to life; <hi>the ſpirit is life becauſe of righteouſneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Were it by adoption it may be by righteouſneſſe, we are <hi>heires of the righteouſneſſe of faith,</hi> if life followeth our new birth, in which adoption is founded, which is imperfect, how much more the perfect righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, by which we are compleatly like unto the Lord? ſo that ther's no fight or oppoſition, but ſweet agreement. When as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>that pretious faith is obtained through the righteouſneſſe of God, and our Saviour Ieſus Chriſt;</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt who is our God and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, adoption or Sonne-ſhip the effect of Faith, muſt needs be an effect of righteouſneſſe; <hi>the cauſe of the cauſe, is the cauſe of the effect,</hi> and by the ſame reaſon adoption is not an higher title then the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, it's founded in it. Our life was the hire and wages of Chriſt, our ſureties obedience. Ther's as well grace and favour in the obedience of Chriſt, and juſtification, as in adoption and life: all are of free grace, juſtice and grace are both in Juſtification 3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 24. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Concl. 6. <hi>That ſatisfaction which Chriſt made to the juſtice of God, and therby procured remiſſion of ſinnes (or perfect righteouſneſſe; and reconciliation with God for thoſe that beleeve, conſiſts only in that obedience of his, which be performed to that peculiar and ſpeciall Law of mediation, which God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon him, which we commonly, though perhaps not ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly call his paſſive obedience, and not at all in that ſubjection which he exhibited to that common law of nature, which we call Morall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Remisſion of ſinnes, and perfect righteouſneſſe are not the ſame, they differ in the cauſe and effect, as Mr. <hi>Gat.</hi> and we before have ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>Reconciliation, though it infoldeth remisſion of ſinnes, is of a larger extent then remisſion. It containes ſlaughter of enmity ſimplie, between us and God, and poſitive amity that which is perfect in regard of <hi>Chriſts</hi> righteouſnes imputed, as well as whats inherent accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to its degree.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:50493:136"/>I confeſſe Chriſts ſatisfaction doth conſiſt only in that obedience of his which he performed to the Law of mediation, impoſed on him by God, and that was our whole debt, which was not only death, but obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Morall Law. We owe unto God perfect obedience, our ſurety muſt ſatisfie that; death excluding obedience was not <hi>ſat is,</hi> it's an ingredient abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to cauſe death to be propitiatory or ſatisfactory.

                  </p>
                  <p>The whole humiliation of Chriſt, beginning at his conception continued to death, conſummated in death, was what was due, what was impoſed, what was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; our nature, holyneſſe and righteouſneſſe of nature and life; his whole ſubjection to the Law, were all due by that law of Mediation; and that was as large as our debt to the Morall Law, the fullfilling of it: deny this, ther's no fullfilling the Law of a Mediator, no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. As for Chriſts obedience to the Law for his owne life, it's vaine, ſeeing he was perfectly living from the firſt moment of his conception.</p>
                  <p>Your reaſon, <hi>becauſe nothing can be ſatisfactory for ſinne to divine juſtice, but what's penall; without blood-ſhedding ther's no remiſſion nor ſatisfaction.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. And nothing can be ſatisfactory but what's penall, ſo was Chriſts whole exinanition and obedience pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall laid on him, and ſubmitted unto as our ſurety, for us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. ſatisfaction for ſinne is but a part, juſtice requireth the whole debt, and that muſt be and is where there is compleat ſatisfaction; your ſelfe hold that active obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence an eſſentiall requiſite to make ſufferings effectuall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The obedience or ſubjection of Chriſt to the Morall Law was no wayes penall to him, 1. it could not be in reſpect of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, it not being paſſive, 2. not to his humane nature, becauſe

it was required of him in innocenty, impoſedon</hi> Adam <hi>before his fall, and ever lyeth on man, and Angels, and Ieſus Chriſt now glorifyed; love the fullfilling of the Law never falleth away. To make obedience to the Morall Law penall, is to affirme man was puniſhed by order from God, before his fall, and that the glorified Saints, Angels, and Chriſt, are now puniſhed in heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. What was impoſed by God before the fall and ever lyeth on man, lyeth on man, never falleth away: the fullfilling of the Law is his debt then, by an eternall Law, and muſt be anſwered by a mans ſelfe or Mediator. It being impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to man our ſurety muſt make ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>2. Subjection of Chriſt to the Morall Law, he being our ſurety, that our debt, muſt needs be penall to him; ſo was his being man, and making under the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. It was neceſſary for our Redemption, who were under the Law, and to our receiving the adoption of ſonnes. It was his humiliation and emptying of himſelfe; his being in forme of a ſervant, his poverty, the perſon was therby abaſed.</p>
                  <p>Neither was he bound to be Man for himſelfe, or to obey for himſelfe, but us, <hi>the children</hi> by predeſtination <hi>being partakers of fleſh and blood, thoſe that were given to him from eternity to give life unto,</hi> ſinning occaſioned his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> neither was it needfull for himſelfe to obey being Man, that he might live when as he lived from the firſt moment of conception.</p>
                  <p>So that though it be not penall ſimply, and to all it muſt be confeſſed ſo to Jeſus Chriſt our ſurety.</p>

                     <hi>Our union is made good by theſe particulars. 1. That by it we are members of that body whereof he is head. 2. That we are partakers of the ſame ſpirit; have fellowſhip in the ſame fruits of the ſpirit with him. 4. That we have part in Redemptionpurcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. 5. Speciall intereſt in his wiſdom, power, &amp; other perfections of his perſon. 6. Compleat title to that immortall inheritance, reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the heavens. 7. Communionwith God himſelf &amp; commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion one with another. Whence to deny the imputation of Chriſts righteouſnes, is no more to deny or obſcure their union, then to deny the miracles Chriſt wrought, are imputed to us, or that to deny a man ſeeth with his hands, or heareth with his heeles, is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the members of the ſame body to have union with the head.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I deny that ther's the ſame reaſon of imputation of Chriſts miracles, and his righteouſneſſe, from our union with him, or of ſeeing with hands, or hearing with heeles, from union of members with the head, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Chriſts righteouſnes our head in union, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is but a cunning or rather palpable puddling of a cleare ſtreame, for your own evaſion, and it's obſerved to be your manner. I cannot ſee with my hands, in your ſenſe, nor heare with my heeles; neither need I hands to ſee; nor heeles to heare. I can be righteous with the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt. It's neceſſary abſolutely, that I may be ſo perfectly.</p>
                  <p>How richly ſoever you be clothed elſe. I profeſſe my ſelfe naked, and have abſolute necesſity of the robes of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, to cover my nakednes. It's what I owe. My Saviours, my ſureties: payment for my free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in necesſity. God made him righteouſneſſe to me, and I <hi>am conſtituted righteous by his obedience.</hi> God never made mine hands eyes to me nor heeles eares, neither by one or other am I conſtituted, ſeeing or hearing. So miracles are not my debt.</p>
                  <p>And though the one follow not from the other; yet
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50493:139"/>
from what you grant by union and communion I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion not but I ſhall deduce by divine or Scripture-Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke participation of righteouſneſſe to juſtification.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the firſt, <hi>that by union I am a member of the body, whereof Chriſt is the head.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. I am a member of Chriſt mine head. 2. and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat in him, which cannot be for righteouſneſſe, but by his, no juſtification; without that, no pardon. I may beleeve it ſeeing his righteouſneſſe was for me: and the word is, by <hi>it I am conſtituted righteous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. You ſay, <hi>we are partakers of the ſame ſpirit.</hi> Then is our union reall, <hi>revera,</hi> and not metaphoricall only.</p>
                  <p>The worke of the <hi>ſpirit of my God,</hi> and <hi>in the name of Chriſt,</hi> is <hi>waſhing,</hi> that's a generall <hi>ſanctification;</hi> both parts; and <hi>justification,</hi> the Spirit applyeth Chriſt and his righteouſnes, putteth on me the beſt robe, and inableth me by faith to cooperate, thereunto to apply the ſame.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Part in redemption,</hi> enfoldeth part in Chriſts ranſome or payment of my debt, my debt being death and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience, require anſwerable death and obedience; death is inſufficient without this eſſentiall requiſite, I have a neceſſity of this righteouſneſſe then to this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                  <p>5. If <hi>by union I have ſpeciall intereſt in his wiſdome and power</hi> too, and <hi>other perfections,</hi> why not in his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? It's a perfection moſt neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>6. If I <hi>have compleat title to that immortall inheritance reſerved in the heavens;</hi> have I no title to that by which adoption and pardon? I and Chriſts righteouſneſſe by which I live; by which I am perfectly like God. Is it not the righteouſnes of Faith, that which we are heirs of, as well as of glory?</p>
                  <p>7. If I <hi>have communion with God himſelf, and his Love,</hi> have I not it in pardon &amp; juſtification, &amp; righteouſnes, by which? is not giving of Chriſts righteouſnes or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation therof, his making me <hi>wholly faire, white as ſnow,</hi> and <hi>whiter,</hi> which is by the faireneſſe and beauty, or righteouſneſſe of Chriſt? Is not his Covenant everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting

                  <p>Concl. 9. <hi>The ſinne of</hi> Adam <hi>is no where in Scripture ſaid to be imputed to Adams poſterity; neither can any other impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation berof, be proved either by Scripture or reaſon, then th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The differences you mention <hi>out of the 15. &amp; 16. of the 8. of the Romans,</hi> concerne not our queſtion. And for the reſt:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The act of <hi>Adam</hi> was the act of the nature of his poſterity not exiſtent, exiſtence was future, and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation future, yet both to be by Gods decree, in and by propagation; and then it was theirs actually.</p>
                  <p>The obediences of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c</hi> were the acts and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of us, that were given Chriſt, and might be ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not perſonall acts or we exiſtent, but as we were to be in time; they were to be ours by imputation in Gods purpoſe and Chriſts intention by union and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt in effectuall call: as <hi>Adam</hi> was a root, Chriſt was a ſurety both in Gods purpoſe; either did, for others. <hi>Adam</hi> for his poſterity, Chriſt for <hi>the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren given unto him</hi> in Gods eternall bargaine: as we are dead and riſen with Chriſt, we may be ſaid to have done and dyed, ſeeing the whole poverty was for us.</p>

                  <p>So Chriſts ſalvation to ſuch as were his children in the purpoſe of God, in that relation, as well as others <hi>his body, bone of his bone, and fleſh of his fleſh,</hi> and ſo in his loynes, to be ſpiritually<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> actually by faith in time, though alſo to be firſt <hi>Adams,</hi> aliens and enemies.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. As the burthen of condemnation by the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> depended on the merit and relation of thoſe that were condemned by him, <hi>videlicet</hi> in Gods purpoſe, as future and to be in act by propagation.</p>
                  <p>So that weight of our redemption, depended on the merit of Chriſt, and relation future by Gods purpoſe; in act by faith, to be in time, by which Chriſt and his merits and benefits are mine, without which actuall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication the worth of what was done and ſuffered, were to no effect.</p>

                  <p>For my part I never feared ſuch Doctrine: And 1. from that word it will not follow (it the ſpeaking of God in the Word be the rule) I finde that word uſed for ſinnes of all ſorts, the greateſt and moſt heinous, which are forgiven by the Lord.

                  <p>The reaſon you give Gods ordination, is no reaſon; we grant Gods will and the nature of Faith are not oppoſite but ſubordinate. Gods will is our Juſtification by Faith that which hath of its nature imbracing laying hold of receiving Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe; cauſing union and communion with him; from whence this righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſneſſe and Juſtification is received and remiſsion, of, ſinnes. The will of God is by this Faith to juſtifie. When God called Aaron to be an high Prieſt, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by fitted him with all requiſites. And ſo when God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained faith, it was ſuch a Faith.</p>
                  <p>Neither is there feare if faith ſhould juſtifie by recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or applying the Object, that it ſhould doe it for the dignity thereof.</p>
                  <p>Faiths <hi>receiving flying for refuge</hi> to Chriſt, is the greateſt argument denying the dignity thereof and demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of indigency and emtyneſſe at home, and is withall, moſt advancing and extolling the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>But it's ridiculous, to ſay ſo; ſeeing Gods will is the cauſe of nature, and the properties therof. It's the will of God by patience to make men patient, humility to make men humble. By naturall cauſes to produce na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall effects. You confeſſe it a truth, and when as ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you deny it the <hi>ſavour or weight of truth.</hi> You deny in your ſelfe a right ſavour of truth, And ſhew your judgement a falſe, ballance againſt conceſsion, denying it weight of truth, The <hi>holy Ghoſt leading into all truth:</hi> ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth

                  <p>Joh. 1. 12, <hi>might be added, where God to thoſe that received Chriſt, that is believed in him, gave the power &amp; prerogative to be his Sons: and by vertue of that decree really made them ſuch on believing.

                  </p>
                  <p>Faith then by a power it receiveth of Gods gift, doth this; ſo doth patience by a power and humility, by a power received, make patient and humble. So fire burneth by a power given to it.

                  <p>For <hi>Paraeus</hi> when as hee putteth Chriſts humiliation from his incarnation to his death, that which is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, cannot exclude the Active obedience of Chriſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed his paſsion was active.

                  <p>Pag. 85. 1, <hi>By making theſe the materiall cauſe of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation they deveſt and spoile them of the honour of cauſality, which is proper unto them, and ſeven times more honourable then that which is this way attributed to them,</hi> vid. <hi>of that cauſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty we call meritorious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Then they are both meritorious which you ſee me to deny, <hi>p</hi> 81.</p>
                  <p>2. Did we deny it meritorious, your argument might be to ſome purpoſe. It's requiſite, that the eſſentiall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of our Juſtification, ſhould have worth in them, and be meritorious.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But this cannot be,</hi> ſay you, by our third Rule. <hi>That no one cauſe whatſoever, can put on more habitudes, or cauſality then one, in reſpect of the ſame effect: So that if Chriſt be the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and impulſive cauſe, which is granted on all hands, even by the men againſt whom I reaſon, it cannot be deemed the materiall cauſe alſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Your Rule is falſe as by that inſtance of <hi>God,</hi> who is the efficient and finall cauſe.

                  <p>3. Yea I pray you conſider whether Chriſt bee not a finall cauſe alſo, whether he had not reſpect to the glory of himſelfe as mediator? Was it not Gods covenant with him, on his execution of Office? 55. <hi>leſ. 5. that he having glorified God on earth, and finiſhed the worke hee gave him to doe, prayeth for</hi> 17.

                  <p>Who knoweth not but man believing is an efficient? You alſo call him the <hi>matter of Iuſtification,,</hi> and you make <hi>the great ſubordinate end which lieth faireſt and fulleſt in view to the ſight of all men, the advancement of perſons juſtified to that exceeding height of glory, &amp;c.</hi> p. 84. <hi>and faith is an inſtrument and impulſive cauſe, true as you.</hi> p. 83.</p>
                  <p>2. You argue, <hi>the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt Active or Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive or both, cannot bee the matter of Iuſtification, becauſe the matter of a thing is alwaies</hi> ens incompletum, <hi>untill the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction and union of the form with it which gives perfection and being and exiſtence to it, but Chriſts righteouſnes hath a perfect being neither can it fall under imagination: whatform it ſhould be capable of that by union with it, ſhould adde beuty and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The righteouſneſſe of Chriſt how perfect ſoever in it ſelfe, yet hath the nature of <hi>ens incompletum,</hi> where and ſo long as it is matter not applyed by Gods imputation, &amp; the <hi>faith</hi> of ſuch as do believe as the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>man,</hi> though compounded of Elements, is <hi>incompletum,</hi> in regard of that effect man, before information.</p>
                  <p>Application of the righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt in ſtead of a forme compleateth not the matter, but the Juſtification of a believer.</p>
                  <p>And yet then hath it &amp; inſomuch (as it were) its deſire, it's appetite to it, and acquieſcence in oying it, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intended by God and Chriſt to that worke believers Juſtification, and other end, as wee ſay of naturall matter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>3. If it bee the matter either properly or improperly ſo called; Matter properly ſo called it cannot be which they call</hi> materia ex qua: <hi>becauſe this kind of matter, I. Is proper to ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:50493:155"/>
natures, onely is it ſelfe alwaies a ſubſtance, is alwaies a part of the nature and the weaker part of it: Whereas Iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion hath onely an accident all being, not ſubſtantiall, &amp;c. not in the predicament of</hi> ſubſtantia: 3. <hi>It cannot be a part of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, it being an action, this a forme or quality: and one predicament all being, cannot be of the nature of another: Laſtly being of that infinite perfection and worth it cannot be the weaker and leſſe worthy part.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I Anſwer: Matter, properly ſo called, we cannot affirme it to be, nor yet do; whence the labour you take here is loſt: When you ſay matter is proper to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall natures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you ſeeme to ſpeake of all ſubſtantiall natures, and ſo to belong to formes, and they ſhall be materiall.</p>
                  <p>When as you ſay <hi>it cannot be the matter of juſtification, it being an action, that a quality:</hi> You cannot but remember that accidents ſimply are reduced to quantity and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and juſtification being a juſt making, as there muſt be ſomewhat that hath proportion to matter <hi>ex qua,</hi> ſo Chriſts righteouſneſſe conſiſteth of actions, and his paſsions were active as before, ſo that ther's good analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy; but I might paſle this.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>That it cannot be matter improperly called, may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſtrated, for that it is either</hi> in qua <hi>or</hi> cerca quam: <hi>the ſubject or object. The righteouſneſſe of Chriſt can be neither of theſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a third thats neither ſubject nor object. Your ſelfe in your explanation of this cauſe prove a third, <hi>the whiteneſſe in the wall. It's enough there be ſome kinde of analogy to matter properly ſo called in accidents.</hi> As your ſelfe ſpeake to the whitening of a wall, there muſt be ſome matter; this I call the colour in chalke or lime the ſubject; this is the matter the Plaiſterer uſeth to white the wall, the chalk-ſtone or lime in which the colour is not that that whiteth, but <hi>qua</hi> whiteneſſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hereth, her's analogy; So when as the Lord maketh juſt and righteous, he doth it with the righteouſneſſe
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:50493:156"/>
of Chriſt; as the wall is made white with that colour, ſo a believer righteous with righteouſneſſe; and in this I ſee the judgement of almoſt all Divines concurring, as before. And thus I paſſe to what you ſay it muſt be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It muſt be either the ſubject or object of Juſtification, God or man: the former is unquoth; it muſt be then</hi> ſubjectum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiens, <hi>or</hi> objectum, <hi>and then that, I believe ther's no other matter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But Sir, if man believing be the matter, either <hi>quâ</hi> man, or believing? not <hi>qua</hi> man, a ſubſtance cannot be the matter of an accident or action: if <hi>quâ</hi> believing faith's an inſtrument, and ſo an efficient, and by your third Rule cannot be the matter. And though our ſubject and object are termed matter, yet the Logician telleth you, that it's confuſion of thoſe which matter<note place="margin">Abutimur no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine materiae cum illud tribui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus ſubjecto et objecto, ipſe <hi>Malancthon</hi> ſaith, <hi>that</hi> Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </p>
                  <p>Of this we have ſpoken; Divines make it an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and give the effect to it, becauſe of that of which it is an inſtrument, the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt ſo all. <hi>Muſculus</hi> and <hi>Aretius,</hi> as is ſhewed. The impulſive is Chriſts righteouſneſſe which is not of the ſame kinde with faith, and ther's the ſame reaſon of other places, where deliverance is given becauſe they believed, which was but a flying for refuge to God in Chriſt, and laying hold by faith as an inſtrument, that which hath the promiſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How Sacraments ſhould become inſtrumentall cauſes or meanes of Inſtification, muſt be knowne by inquiring at the Oracle at</hi> Rome <hi>for neither the Scriptures nor the Reformed Religion have any of this learning in them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sacraments are viſible words, and their office is to ſigne and ſeale to believers, the whole Covenant in the blood of Chriſt. The Apoſtle calleth <hi>Circumciſion, the

                  <p>
                     <hi>Doubtleſſe her's too much matter to make a good forme.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if all be rightly taken, there's what doth it. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification is by the communion and imputation reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall of our ſinnes to Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe to us: that which followeth ſheweth how it's effected by the Spirit dwelling in us working faith; this recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call imputation and communion is the formall cauſe of our Juſtification.</p>
                  <p>By this the matter is applyed, we are made perfectly righteous, and freed from our ſinnes. Againſt this you object:</p>

                  <p>And juſtification of Chriſt as well as us might follow, if righteouſneſſe were communicated or imputed to him in Mr. <hi>Walkers</hi> ſpeech by the Holy Ghoſt, or from us, but theſe are dreames and miſtakes you ſay,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If communion be reciprecall, imputation is not, which yet, is affirmed by the ſame breath, becauſe this is an act of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where as communion floweth from the Holy Ghoſt, theſe are acts really diffiring, impoſſible to combine as one forme. &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The conſequence is denyed, and the reaſon that they are two differing acts; both denote but the application of the matter, which is by analogy the forme, or intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of it, and when you prove it becauſe one is done by God the Father, the other by the Spirit, you ſeem to forget that both perſons are one God, and that God, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son and Holy Ghoſt juſtifie: the Spirit is the Spirit of our God and we are juſtified by the ſpirit of our God.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>Reciprocall imputation by it ſelfe cannot be the forme, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it comprehends two diſtinct acts of God, imputation of our ſinnes to Chriſt and of his righteouſneſſe to us, which really dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, now its impoſſible that any forme ſhould be made of plurality oſ ingredients.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are the ſame acts of God; God on mans belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving conferreth the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt on him, and acquitteth him of his finnes, they being by the ſame act put upon the ſcore of Chriſt. This I ſuppoſe was his meaning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="119" facs="tcp:50493:158"/>And if our queſtion were of a forme properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, we might nearken to your axiome, and yet put you to worke to tell us what is <hi>for ma miſti,</hi> whether it hath not many ingredients, whether the formes of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall elements are annihilated, or made matter, or are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients to the forme, and if not, how there can be a reſolution of them, and how there are ſtill their proper qualities; but this were to be wanton.</p>
                  <p>For accidents its manifeſt, learning as a forme maketh learned, and when we judge one ſo indeed, its from all or many ſorts of learning, theres not onely a plurality but multiplicity of Learning.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Its impoſſible, becauſe onely the believing ſinner is (as hath been fully proved) is the matter of juſtification; now the forme is ever in conjunction with the matter proper to it, and never with any other: Chriſt being no believing ſinner, is no fitting matter for the forme of that Inſtification to be coupled with it, it cannot be that imputation of ſinnes to him ſhould be the forme is ſelfe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which is the foundation is ſandy, that a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſinner is the matter of juſtification, its ſhewed to be ſo before; theres no juſtification of Chriſt aſlerted, and ſo no need that he ſhould be a believing finner.</p>
                  <p>When God juſtifieth us he acquiteth us of our ſinnes by the ſame act he removeth them from us, he tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlateth them to Chriſts account.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>No imputation whatſoever, or of whatſoever can be the forme of Inſtification. 1. Becauſe its no righteouſneſſe, where as a formes of Iuſtification muſt of neceſſity be a righteouſneſſe; righteouſneſſe imputed is a righteouſneſse, but the imputation of righteouſneſse cannot be righteouſneſse.</hi>

                  <p>Righteouſneſſe, its true, muſt be to make one righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, but thats the matter, imputation of it or it impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted is the forme, the introduction of this which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation hath the place of a forme.</p>

                     <hi>If the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt be the matter and imputation thereof the forme, then one righteouſneſſe muſt be the forme of another righteouſneſſe, becauſe the forme muſt needs be a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe; if the matter and forme be a righteouſneſſe, one muſt informe the other; a greater abſurdity then the reaſon of any conſidering man can beare</hi>

                  <p>For proofe making you promiſe:</p>
                  <p>1: <hi>Iuſtification being an action hath no forme properly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, nor any forme properly a part of it.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>5. <hi>We inquire of that which is conſtitutive, Gods making a man righteous, whence declaring followeth:</hi> And thus I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to demonſtrate the truth of that propoſition, that remiſsion is the formall cauſe of Juſtification.</p>
                  <p>1. I take granted, your fourth; its of ſuch a juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                  <p>2. Its granted, it hath no proper forme, and that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly it can not be a part, yet there is a forme, and that's a part, it's conſtitutive as your ſelfe, eſſentiall, a part.</p>
                  <p>3. That it makes a reall change, for it makes a ſinner juſt, it maketh an unjuſt man righteous.</p>
                  <p>3. That the effect of the act of God juſtifying is the forme, I deny, its whole juſtification, and all ſuch eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall parts as make it up, and you muſt remember the formes act hath efficacy, for <hi>dat eſſe.</hi> ſee <hi>c. 3. diſt.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>4. It's granted, it's conſtitutive of juſtification, as <hi>anima rationalis</hi> of a man. And now for your Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Becauſe remiſſion of ſinnes is the firſt preciſe effect of that act, therfore its the formal cauſe of Juſtification, there's noother imaginable effect intervening, there's an immediate connexion betweene juſtification and the ſinners abſolution, when its called Iuſtification from ſin,</hi> 13 Acts 38 <hi>ſo</hi> 6 Rom. 7 <hi>he that is dead is juſtified from ſinne, this is the firſt priviledge that comes upon a ſinner by meanes of juſtification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. I deny the conſequence, the effect is paſsive juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication as you diſtinguiſh, <hi>and that ſignifieth moſt properly and moſt frequently that compleate and entire effect, wherein all their ſeverall influences and contributions meet and center to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi> p. 38. Whole juſtification, the intire effect, and the forme are not the ſame, the forme is but a part of a thing, and cannot be the entire effect.</p>
                  <p>2. I deny remiſsion of ſinnes, the firſt preciſe effect, ther's imputation or application of righteouſneſſe, of which juſtification is an effect, as is ſhewed out of Mr.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50493:163"/>
                     <hi>Wotton, 1 tr. p.</hi> 84. of righteouſneſſe communicated, on which pardon followeth.</p>
                  <p>Neither doth their connection prove it, ſuch is there betweene ſanctification and juſtification; and for that place <hi>Acts</hi> 13. you urg'd it to this purpoſe once before, and have an anſwere in the fift argument.</p>
                  <p>2 <hi>Becauſe remiſſion of ſinnes giveth denomination of juſtified, it is the forme.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Grant this, (though the illuſtration be not by white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and whitning, wherein you make whiteneſſe the forme, which is the effect, the form is whiting, applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) you muſt prove the minor, that it denominateth, which you do thus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If a ſinner be therefore and thereby juſtified becauſe he hath his ſinnes remitted unto him, then remiſſion of ſinnes giveth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination of the juſtified to him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is a meere begging of the queſtion, what's to be proved; and I deny a ſinner therefore juſtified, unleſſe you prove it, juſtification by an effect, or thereby, your Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Becauſe Iuſtification it is a vindication or exemption from puniſhment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is ſo in effect, that is that followeth, but ſomewhat is ſuppoſed thereunto, juſt making and being juſt, elſe will it be the <hi>juſtification of a wicked perſon abomination to the Lord,</hi> as both the Scripture, and Divines pleading the ſame.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Remiſſion of ſins is the formall cauſe of Iuſtification becauſe it is that alteration and change that's cauſed in the perſon juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by that act of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. I deny the conſequence, every change or alteration the perſon, <hi>is not the forme.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By that act of God is not the forme, ſo peace of<note place="margin">A.</note> conſcience ſhould be ſo, for its an alteration which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth pardon, which ſuppoſeth imputation of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, whence juſtification and ſo pardon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. So is juſtification it ſelfe in that change that's

made, yet is it not therefore the forme of it ſelfe, nay its an effect of the forme. Your Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Its a politique act, and it hath a ſutable effect, not a Morall, the change is not ſo, now, then this there's no other imaginable act, before this he was under guilt, now freed by this.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It's a divine act<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and though it be granted politique and that the effect, there's a Morall change, ſuch a man as hath his ſinnes forgiven him, was under guilt but now free; true, hee was alſo unjuſt whence that guilt, and now he is righteous, <hi>conſtituted righteous, holy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blamable, white as ſnow, whiter</hi> by a beauty put on him, whence remiſsion a conſequent, here's an other change</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>That which makes a juſtified perſon compleatly righteous before God is the formall cauſe of Iuſtification, this cannot be denyed by our keeneſt adverſaries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, making is ambiguous, every cauſe maketh the efficient the finall, the materiall, the formall, a blunt man might make exception. But let it paſſe, let us ſee your aſſumption.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But remiſſion of ſinnes maketh a juſtified perſon formally and</hi>
                     <note place="margin">G.</note> 
                     <hi>compleatly righteous, becauſe he is as cleere from ſinne or the guilt as he that kept the Law and never tranſgreſſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, remiſsion maketh not formally righteous, and I deny the reaſon, for though he be without ſinnes guilt, nay ſo righteous, the cauſe is righteouſneſſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, ſuppoſed, <hi>by Chriſts obedience we are conſtituted righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. <hi>If remiſſiion of ſinnes be perfect and compleate righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, then is it the formall cauſe of Iuſtification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The light ſet up to this.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Becauſe no perfect or compleate righteouſneſſe can be found in any man that hath ſinned, but that which is given and conferred by God in his Iuſtification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But remiſsion of ſinnes is a compleate righteouſneſſe, which propoſition hath been oft alreedy exalted upon the Throne of evidence, and unqueſtionableneſſe of truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is and hath been as often denyed, and with reaſon
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:50493:164"/>
too: be it ſo, let the Reader judge; but now we muſt take a further demonſtration.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That righteouſneſſe which needeth not feare the preſence of a moſt diſtrict judgement of God, is a compleate righteouſneſſe. But remiſsion is ſuch, it will hold weight and meaſure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you are to prove is that remiſsion is a compleat righteouſneſſe, this you prove it by, beggeth what's the queſtion that it's righteouſneſſe, every thing that will abide the preſence of God is not by and by righteouſneſſe, in our love there's no feare, yet is it not righteouſneſſe by which we are juſtified, when as you adde.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>What ſhall hinder but that immediately on remiſsion of ſinnes enſue a perfect union of love and peace between them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In theſe you ſeeme to lay down the iſſue of pardon to be a union of love and peace betweene them; It's true theres a love and peace that followeth, but as for an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as if that followed and did not go in nature before, is not to be ſuffered, we have ſhewed the word ſaith, <hi>in whom we have redemption, remiſsion of ſinnes in his blood,</hi> its what we have in him, and therefore muſt be firſt in and have union, it's what we have by communion, partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of his righteouſneſſe as we have ſhewed, which ſuppoſeth union, remiſsion of ſinnes without union is remiſsion of ſins not by and in, but out of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>6. You argue. <hi>For giveneſſe is the formall cauſe, becauſe it is the righteouſneſſe which God imputeth in Iuſtification,</hi> which you prove to follow, <hi>becauſe the righteouſneſſe which God imputes in juſtification, muſt needs be the formall cauſe therof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The minor is the aſſertion of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Rom. 4. 6. <hi>Gods imputeing righteouſneſſe,</hi> ver. 7. <hi>is interpreted to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving iniquities and covering of ſinne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. It is our tenet, that righteouſneſſe imputed is the formall cauſe of juſtification.</p>
                  <p>2. But we deny that righteouſneſſe to be forgiveneſſe of ſinnes: It's not righteouſneſſe; It's an effect or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of juſtification by the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:50493:164"/>
imputed, and of that righteouſneſſe of Chriſt we have ſhewed, the Apoſtle to ſpeake, <hi>ver,</hi> 6. and <hi>ver.</hi> 11. and this not our owne but as received by faith of the God of our ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>Remiſſion of ſinnes reacheth home unto, and is given to men by God for their juſtification, therefore it is the formall cauſe thereof, this is evident, becauſe by the formall cauſe we meane nothing elſe but paſſive juſtification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer. 1. Many things may be given by God for juſtification ſome waies or other, which yet are not the formall cauſe thereof, the word and faith are given for juſtification.</p>
                  <p>2. I deny remiſsion given for juſtification; I aſſert juſtification given for pardon, for it is its effect, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent, as hath been often ſhewed; <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 16. men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made of remiſsion, a gift: There's alſo mention of the gift of righteouſneſſe, whence juſtification and pardon alſo, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. 19.</p>
                  <p>And if remiſsion of ſinnes be juſtification paſsive, the effect of God juſtifying, it cannot be the formall cauſe thereof, it hath as good an efficient, ſo the formall cauſe active thereunto as your ſelfe, where you name that diſtinction. <hi>par. 2. p.</hi> 37. It can not be cauſe and effect both, before and after it ſelfe, the whole and a part.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>Remiſſion is the formall cauſe, becauſe that &amp; not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting ſins ſignifie the ſame priviledge, which you prove becauſe the Holy Ghoſt interpreteth the righteouſneſſe which God impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth by non-imputation of ſinnes,</hi> Rom. 4. 6. <hi>compared with</hi> ver. 8. <hi>and the righteouſneſſe that is imputed in the formall cauſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. I grant that righteouſneſſe imputed is the formall cauſe. 2. And that remiſsion and non-imputation are the ſame: Yet deny the conſequence, and that becauſe remiſsion of ſinnes is not righteouſneſſe, neither that which is imputed, the text calleth it faith, which is not forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, and being faith, it muſt be in a figurative ſenſe, takeing in the righteouſneſſe of

                     <p>Chriſt fullfilled all righteouſneſſe, which imputed is as large as they need, and how it can follow that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Law is not meant, were ther's a fulffilling all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, or a righteouſnes imputed, which is the fulfilling of all righteouſnes, I conceive not.</p>

                     <p>1. Chriſts ſufferings are not in themſelves a full diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, they muſt be imputed.</p>
                     <p>2. They muſt have <hi>concurring as an eſſentiall requiſite,</hi> Chriſts active obedience, if which they be imputed they take away the curſe: did you never heare of this before: and yet diſpute it ſo often?</p>

workes of the Law, notwithſtanding the many things wherin all offend, in Gods account: thoſe that hold the imputation of the Paſsive obedience alone doe ſo, or muſt grant no man living in <hi>Gods</hi> account a perfect fulfiller of the Law, or perfectly righteous, which yet you argue for; for it taketh away ſinnes and that man is perfectly juſt as you teach.</p>
                     <p>Whenas therefore you ſay all the imputations under heaven, of whatſoever, from whomſoever can not; you oppoſe imputation of an others righteouſneſſe or obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience ſimply, imputation of that which is paſsive of Chriſt alſo.

                     <p>5. Ult. <hi>The meaning is, every one that expecteth juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Law, the Curſe will fall heavy upon him. It's to be limited to the univerſality of them onely who depend on the Law for juſtification.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. I grant that every one that expecteth juſtification by the Law is accurſed, by this Scripture; but this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth not the Argument, which is that therefore to avoyd that curſe there muſt be perfect obedience impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by which we muſt be perfectly righteous, and avoyd the curſe, we muſt have it to avoyd the Curſe, either our own or anothers, its impoſsible by our own obedience, we muſt have it by anothers, and that cannot be but by imputation, and ſo might paſſe the reſt as not to the matter.</p>
                     <p>2. It's a truth of thoſe, but it muſt not be limited to them; if ſo, then onely juſticiaries that looke to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by the Law perſonally performed are under the curſe and not ſinners ſimply (eſpecially, which in the Church, and ſo under the Law) impenitent men though they hate that opinion are under the curſe, by that place of Scripture.</p>

And therefore alſo we may reject faith in proper ſenſe becauſe it's not of worth and value, it cannot juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie formally.

                     <p>It's one thing to be miniſteriall and inſtrumentall, an other to be the materiall and formall cauſe, ſo much as you take from perfection of thoſe yea from merit and worth, ſo much you take from the perfection of our rightouſneſſe, no effect can exceed the cauſe of it.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>The major followes not, that God ſhould receive from us or not we from God. 1. Becauſe faith is not a righteouſneſſe proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but that God by the meanes thereof, and tender of it lookes on us as righteous, not as made meriteriouſly or formally righteous by it, but as having performed the condition to which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is made of making us righteous, meritoriouſly by the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his Sonne, and formally by remiſſion.</hi>

                     <p>To the Reaſon, 1. Faith in a proper ſenſe, is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a righteouſneſſe, that which is called inherent. <hi>It may both with truth and properiety of speech be called and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a righteouſneſſe, yea the ſmalleſt degree, ſo you,</hi> p. 176. on tender of this that followeth, ſo that we ſtill receive not.</p>
                     <p>2. That which is excluded is denyed, that whereby we are formally juſtified, and therefore that which is aſſerted, faith in a proper ſenſe ſhould be by oppoſition the formall cauſe; that its a meanes in our ſenſe is not queſtioned, and that which maketh us formally muſt

                     <p>2. <hi>If faith were righteouſneſſe, it followes not, that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives from us a righteouſneſſe, we rather receive faith from God for our juſtification.</hi>

                  <p>1 <hi>Argu.</hi> If there be no ſtanding in Judgement before God except we be indued with perfect righteouſneſſe, then muſt the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt be imputed to us in our juſtification.</p>
                  <p>But there is no ſtanding for us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I deny the conſequence, there may be no ſtanding in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before</hi> God, <hi>and yet the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, in the ſenſe controverted not be imputed. Remiſſion of ſinnes purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the death of Chriſt is ſo, as in the 5. firſt concluſions,</hi> p. 3. <hi>&amp; 4. Yea our Divines as</hi> Calvin <hi>finde ſufficient ſtrength for confidence in the death of Chriſt alone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. The righteouſneſſe of Chriſt aſſerted by us is his active and paſſive obedience, what weakneſſe is it then for you to aſſert his paſsive obedience by way of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition unto us, and to deny imputation therof. And I appeale to the Reader how you can exclude the active obedience of Chriſt, and ſeparate it from the paſsive, which you aſſert the purchaſer of pardon, when as your ſelfe call that active obedience <hi>an eſſentiall requiſite to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the paſſive obedience meritorious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Calvin</hi> doth not exclude the imputation of Chriſts active obedience to the Law from Chriſts death; I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to what's anſwered before out of him.</p>
                  <p>2. Remiſsion of ſinnes is no righteouſneſſe, neither is it to be confounded as if it were the ſame with <hi>Chriſts</hi>
                     <pb n="205" facs="tcp:50493:196"/>
death, they are cauſe and effect: remiſsion indeed is a conſequent of Juſtification; let the Reader obſerve the Reference.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Arg.</hi> He that is juſtified by an others righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe muſt be juſtified by Chriſts imputed, for no other righteouſneſſe is fit.</p>
                  <p>But every man that is juſtified is juſtified by the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of an other, and not his own.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>I deny the Major, a man may be juſtified by the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of another, and yet no neceſſity of Chriſts active obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (of which onely the queſtion i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>) to be imputed to him, the paſſive obedience of Chriſt: by merit of which communicated in free pardon without further righteouſneſſe derived upon them in a way of imputation or however, of which ſec 4. or 5. Concluſ.</hi> p. 5. 6. 7.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, by the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt we meane active and paſsive, and I never read of one that held the active alone, you do but fight with a ſhaddow.</p>
                  <p>2. And ſhewed but now that you putting the paſsive, cannot exclude the active, the paſsive without that isnot meritorious and that the imputation of both are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to juſtification of which pardon is a conſequent.</p>
                  <p>Your communicated and our imputed are one with us and with you, or elſe with Mr. Wotten and <hi>Socinus</hi> you deny imputation of Chriſts paſsive obedience in which you are deſerted even by Mr Gattaker, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>Now by formally you may know (and do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſomewhere I remember) we meane not inherent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that's the Popiſh forme of Juſtification which we oppoſe; this is ſo our own as it is not anothers, ſo is my Faith, and Hope and Charity.</p>
                  <p>And you ſhall never prove that we are juſtified by that which is ſo our own and no others.</p>
                  <p>That we are juſtified by, is Chriſts inherently or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectivly only, though ours by donation and poſſeſsion, not ſubjectivly further then as Chriſt in whom it is dwelleth in us, by his Spirit and faith, it's his and ours as he is <hi>the Lord our righteouſneſſe made unto us righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>1. <hi>The propoſition wants truth, becauſe a true and reall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt may ſtand without his active obedience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made theirs by imputation,</hi> ſee c. 10. ſect 4. &amp; 5. of the former par c. 2. p. 9. &amp; 10. of this 2. par</p>
                  <p>The queſtion is what maketh man righteous; we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert the active and paſſive obedience of Chriſt imputed or given us, and applied by faith: we adde this is done by reall.

To your exception, Communion is denyed where his active obedience is not made ours. It's a demonſtration, Communion is the cauſe, Chriſts active obedience it's being, ours the effect, it's like that of the Apoſtle; <hi>as many of us as are Baeptized into Chriſt, are Baptized into his death,</hi> 6. Rom. 3. the difference is, his death is named and not his active obedience: It's not excluded more then his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and if it <hi>infloweth and concurreth; be an eſſentiall requiſite,</hi> to the efficacy of his death, With what face can you granting the one, deny the other? Imputation then is the buſineſſe: but imputation of Chriſts paſsive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is granted to us by <hi>Piſcator, Paraeus,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aker,</hi> we are altogether here againſt <hi>Socinus</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wotton,</hi> and you being Judge, <hi>the eſſentiall requiſite cannot

                     <hi>It's true, unbelievers are debtors in both respects, if they mean to be juſtified, otherwiſe then by Chriſt, becauſe there's no third way, he muſt keepe the whole himſelfe.</hi>

                  <p>Unbelievers as you ſay are debtors in both, to do and ſuffer to juſtification. Very well, their ſuretie then muſt pay their debt, if he will be their juſtifier he muſt ſuffer he muſt fulfill the Law.</p>
                  <p>Put Chriſt doing and ſuffering, and man a believer, I yeeld he is not bound to do, to live, he was before faith, by faith, being a partaker of the ſatisfaction of Chriſt,</p>

                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>When you grant it of his ſufferings, how can you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude his obedience to the Morall Law, teaching the world that that obedience was an <hi>eſſentiall requiſite</hi> to the benefit of juſtification; and it's no paralogiſme.</p>
                  <p>9. <hi>Arg.</hi> If. Chriſt were a publique perſon ſtanding in the place of all thoſe that ſhould believe in him, then all he did and ſuffered are reputed as don and ſuffered by theſe, and imputed to them. But Chriſt was <hi>&amp;c..</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. <hi>The Major is weake and untrue, his ſtanding in the place of beluvers is no ground that all that he did and ſuffered are leaked on as done and ſuffered by them, as his incarnation, birth, circumciſion, ſubjection to</hi> Joſeph, <hi>&amp;c. Redemption of the World, why ſhould I a believing Gentile be looked on at one cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, what advantage have I to be looked on in Chriſt as one that was ſubject to</hi> Joſeph, <hi>how ſhould I feare and tremble to conceite that God ſhould looke on me as having redeemed the world out of the greateſt acts Chriſt did.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This argument is put in publique words not proper to diſgrace it, whoſe it is, as layd down I know not, but thinke it your own.</p>
                  <p>I would put it, That which Chriſt did and ſuffered as the ſuretie of believers in their ſtead, which they were debtors in to God; that's looked on as done and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their's by imputation, the Scripture ſheweth him our ſurety: this is our Churches lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and it is <hi>Dr. Davenants</hi> Arg.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="217" facs="tcp:50493:202"/>Had you taken our Arguments as layd downe and ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged but this Doctors, it would have been ſomewhat: ſuch hungry laying them down as is found in you, leaveth out their hart, and is not ingenuous.</p>
                  <p>And here we may ſee how what you object would vaniſh, redemption of the world was none of my debt. It's inough that in him I have redemption.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>It hath been demonſtrated that it's not truth to ſay the ſufferings of Chriſt are locked on as mine, it may be ſaid hee ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in my ſtead, we cannot be ſaid to be puniſhed for the ſame ſinnes in and with Chriſt for which we have remiſſion in his death, as Dr.</hi> Willet.</p>
                  <p>1. Your demonſtrations (as you love to ſpeake) are all examined, and that in it's place.</p>
                  <p>2. We ſay no more but that he ſuffered in our ſtead, it is, <hi>perinde ac ſi in me reperia, aut à me preſtita fuiſſet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What my ſurety doth, is as if I had done it, and ſo our Homily, <hi>every Chriſtian man in him and by him may be called a fulfiller of the Law, what was lacking in us being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. The iſſue of the buſineſſe is not all, our queſtion is not about the effect, juſtification pardon, life. But that by which; which is granted to be by ſatisfaction made to God our Creditor by our ſurety Chriſt, which as it was performed for us, is ours imputed as the Scripture, the word ſaith, we have it by fellowſhip with his blood. I and with his obedience to death, by his obedience we are made righteous, when you ſay,</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>It's not ſo ſound a truth as ſuppoſed, that Chriſt ſtood in the ſtead or place of believers, in all things performed by him... Chriſt did a thouſand things and ſuffered many of which we had no neceſſity as to be borne of a Virgin:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. This is the ſame with the firſt: as it's layd down out of the Doctor, there are no ſuch unlimited words, but as our ſurety, and as ſatisfaction for our debt.</p>
                  <p>That we keepe our ſelves to, we ſay Chriſt for us; and we ſay that he was obedient that by it we may be made
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:50493:203"/>
righteouſneſſe: You will us <hi>to ſee, c. 3. ſect. 11. of the 2. part.</hi> Which you ſhall find examined.</p>
                  <p>2. If Chriſt ſuffered many things we have no need of tell us whether it was for himſelfe, or whom or in vaine</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 10. If we cannot be juſtified by the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt otherwiſe then by imputation of it, then muſt it needs be imputed to us in our juſtification.</p>
                  <p>But there's no way of being juſtified, but onely by the imputation of it.</p>
                  <p>You anſwer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The active obedience of Chriſt hath influence otherwiſe, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying the perſon for the Sacrifice of himſelfe, by which juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is purchaſed, as before. That it's not by imputation hath been proved by 3 demonſtrations and 4. and that our quiver is well nigh exhauſt. I know not 2 Arguments more really dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Your Demonſtrations againſt imputation are all examined.</p>
                  <p>2. Put that influence of the active obedience in to the ſacrifice of Chriſt to make it propitiatory, I hope it doth not deny imputation, that's granted by thoſe that hold onely Chriſts paſsive obedience: It's urged and obſerved by them that they may not be accounted <hi>Socinians,</hi> nor numbred with them. I ſee you will leave them there and be ſo your ſelfe if you deny the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe.</p>
                  <p>The Scripture layeth down imputation of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, which is Gods way of application, his giving it to us clothing us with it, without which we ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be the better for it. And it followeth not that our quiver is exhauſt becauſe you know no more, one may judge you willingly ignorant. Let any man read our Worthies in this queſtion, againſt Papiſts, and hee ſhall read many arguments untouched; I wiſſe Arrowes fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered and headed and ſhot in an other manner of bow, by an other manner of arme then is preſented by you.</p>

                  <p>To omit that there's not one, but is managed againſt your gaineſaying. But I will not word it.</p>
                  <p>11 <hi>Arg.</hi> If we may be ſaid truely to be dead with Chriſt, crucified, quickened raiſed, and to ſit in in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly places with Chriſt, then may we be truely ſaid to have fulfilled the Law with Chriſt alſo (there's no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference) and conſequently it's imputed to us and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ours.</p>
                  <p>But we may be, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Whoſe this is I know not, nor am I bound to ſpend time about it. It may be you made it as a man of clouts your ſelfe, or mared it otherwiſe made, that you might ſhoot at it: the force that's aimed at (if I miſſe not) is to the ſame purpoſe that we have ſpoken to in that head of Communion of which enough, and ſo Ile paſſe to your laſt named argument.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 12 Whoſoever is a ſinner and ſo continueth whilſt he lives cannot be juſtified otherwiſe then by the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt. But every man, Chriſt onely excepted is ſo.</p>
                  <p>You Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If there be no other way or meanes the condition of the world is miſerable, for ſuch there's none, as hath been proved, beyond all reaſonable deniall, except I be miſtaken:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But bleſſed be the Father of mercies.—who without that Key hath opened an effectuall doors of Iuſtification to ſinners, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are not under the Law but grace and there's no condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them, and if any man ſinne we have an Advocate,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Diſſolving guilt needs no imputation of the active obedience, the propitiation by blood hath done this ſervice, before this imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſuppoſed to come at them. The merit of Chriſts death is not ſo far exhauſt on pardon that it will not ſerve to acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Adoption is from his blood. The perfect holyneſſe of his perſon and righteouſneſſe of his life preſuppoſed as hath been
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:50493:204"/>
ſaid. He that hath communion with his death ſhall not know what to doe with the imputation of his life, after it, but enough if not more then enough of this before.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here's enough indeed, and more then enough of this.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let the Reader judge an otherwhile, you may be miſtaken, and in a miſerable caſe, being ſo profeſſed an enemie to imputation, and the cauſe of miſtake to ſo many others.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Who queſtions believers being under grace, or ſaith that they have condemnation? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will not theſe ſtand with imputation of righteouſneſſe? are you alone the Dr. of thoſe concluſions? are your adverſaries, ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to thoſe encluſions? you take too much upon you.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Diſſolving guilt needs imputation of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; nay, thence followeth non-imputation of ſinne as the Apoſtle. And <hi>Paraeus</hi> ſo anſwereth Papiſts as before.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Diſſolution of ſinnes guilt by Chriſts, blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore imputation is diſſolution before application that which putteth the effect before the cauſe, your friends will not hould with you.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Let the merit of Chriſt death be infinite if it be not applied, imputed by God, received by us, it will not have any effect, there's neither pardon, nor adoption; there muſt be communion with his death firſt, before there be the effects, which is by imputation.</p>
                  <p>And who ſeeth not but that deſpiſed things, the holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſts perſon and righteouſneſſe of his life are ſuppoſed by your ſelfe, to this efficacy of his blood, <hi>to make it a Sacrifice to Iuſtification, that without which Chriſts death was in vaine?</hi> and muſt there not be fellowſhip with it, bloods eſſentiall requiſite alſo.</p>
                  <p>Fellowſhip with one and other are together, not firſt with death then life, the iſſues are from both; imputed or given to us, received by faith. Will you ſeparate blood and it's <hi>eſſentiall requiſite</hi> or communion with them to Juſtification? you cannot.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="221" facs="tcp:50493:204"/>And now you make an end with, <hi>we have overcome,</hi> and yet I am not ſatisfied, and I have laboured to give you an account therof, the iſſue I leave to God, praying in your forme; The Lord by his Spirit leade us in to the way of truth and keepe us that we turne not aſide either to the right or left hand, that we may be ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly built up in our holy faith and fitted for his everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kingdome.</p>
